        "Item 1C. Cybersecurity Risk Management and Strategy We have implemented and maintain various information security processes designed to identify, assess, and manage material risks from cybersecurity threats to our critical computer networks, third party hosted services, communications systems, hardware and software, and our critical data, including intellectual property, personal information, confidential information that is proprietary, strategic or competitive in nature, and customer data (\u201cInformation Systems and Data\u201d). The Chief Information Security Officer, in coordination with our Chief Financial Officer, Chief Accounting Officer, certain members of the Company\u2019s legal team and certain third-party service providers (\u201cCybersecurity Risk Management Team\u201d), is primarily responsible for identifying, assessing, and managing the Company\u2019s cybersecurity threats and risks. Through our Cybersecurity Risk Management Team, we identify and assess risks from cybersecurity threats by monitoring and evaluating our threat environment and the Company\u2019s risk profile using various methods including, for example manual and automated tools, conducting scans of threat environment, use of external intelligence feeds, internal and third-party threat assessments and evaluating our industry\u2019s risk profile, subscribing to reports and services that identify cybersecurity threats, evaluating threats reported to us, and conducting red/blue team testing and tabletop incident response exercises. Depending on the particular environment and system, we implement and maintain various technical, physical, and organizational measures, processes, standards, and policies designed to manage and mitigate material risks from cybersecurity threats to our Information Systems and Data, including, for example: network security controls, system monitoring, incident detection and response, incident response policy, disaster recovery and business continuity plans, vulnerability management policy, penetration testing, encryption of data, data segregation controls, employee training, physical security cyber insurance, vendor risk management program, risk assessments, implementation of security standards/certifications, access controls, dedicated cybersecurity staff, and asset management, tracking and disposal. Our assessment and management of material risks from cybersecurity threats are integrated into the Company\u2019s overall risk management processes. For example, security management works with senior management to prioritize our risk management processes and mitigate cybersecurity threats that are more likely to lead to a material impact to our business, and reports to the audit committee of the board of directors, which reviews our overall risk management framework and programs. We use third-party service providers to assist us from time to time to identify, assess, and manage material risks from cybersecurity threats, including for example threat intelligence service providers, cybersecurity consultants, cybersecurity software providers, penetration testing firms, forensic investigators, dark web monitoring services, and professional service firms, including legal counsel. We use third-party service providers to perform a variety of functions throughout our business, such as application providers and hosting companies. We have a vendor management program to manage cybersecurity risks associated with our use of these providers. The program includes risk assessments for each vendor, security questionnaires, audits, and review of security reports. Depending on the nature of the services provided, the sensitivity of the Information Systems and Data at issue, and the identity of the provider, our vendor management process may involve different levels of assessment designed to help identify cybersecurity risks associated with a provider and impose contractual obligations related to cybersecurity on the provider. For a description of the risks from cybersecurity threats that may materially affect the Company and how they may do so, see our risk factors under Part 1. Item 1A. Risk Factors in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including \u201cRisks Related to Cybersecurity.\u201d Governance Our board of directors addresses the Company\u2019s cybersecurity risk management as part of its general oversight function. The board of directors\u2019 audit committee is responsible for overseeing the Company\u2019s cybersecurity risk management processes, including oversight and mitigation of risks from cybersecurity threats. Our cybersecurity risk assessment and management processes are implemented and maintained by certain Company management, including the Chief Information Security Officer, who oversees the Company\u2019s Trust and Security department, and the members of the Cybersecurity Risk Management Team. Our Trust and Security department has significant collective experience in relevant computer science and engineering disciplines and cybersecurity matters. The Chief Information Security Officer is responsible for hiring appropriate personnel, helping to integrate cybersecurity risk considerations into the Company\u2019s overall risk management strategy, and communicating key priorities to relevant personnel. The Chief Information Security Officer is also responsible for approving budgets, helping to prepare for cybersecurity incidents, approving cybersecurity processes, and reviewing security assessments and other security-related reports. Our cybersecurity incident response and vulnerability management processes and policies are designed to escalate certain cybersecurity incidents to members of management depending on the circumstances, including senior management. Senior management works with the Company\u2019s incident response team to help the Company mitigate and remediate cybersecurity incidents of which they are notified. In addition, the Company\u2019s incident response and vulnerability management processes and policies include reporting to the management disclosure committee and to the audit committee of the board of directors for certain cybersecurity incidents. The audit committee receives regular reports from the Chief Information Security Officer concerning the Company\u2019s significant cybersecurity threats and risks and the processes the Company has implemented to address them. The audit committee also receives various reports, summaries or presentations related to cybersecurity threats, risks, and mitigation measures."

        "2. Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Basis of Presentation The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (\u201cGAAP\u201d) and include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Reclassifications Certain amounts in the prior year consolidated financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the presentation of the current year consolidated financial statements. These reclassifications had no effect on consolidated net loss, stockholders\u2019 equity, or cash flows as previously reported. Use of Estimates The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Such estimates include, but are not limited to, the standalone selling price (\u201cSSP\u201d) for each distinct performance obligation included in customer contracts, deferred contract acquisition costs and their period of benefit, stock-based compensation expense, the fair value of acquired intangible assets, capitalization of internal-use software, estimated useful lives of long-lived assets, the incremental borrowing rate used to measure operating lease liabilities, and accounting for income taxes. The Company bases its estimates on historical and anticipated results, trends, and various other assumptions that it believes are reasonable under the circumstances. Estimates and assumptions about future events and their effects, including the impact of global macroeconomic conditions, cannot be determined with certainty and therefore require the exercise of judgment. Actual results could differ from those estimates and any such differences may be material to the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements. Functional Currency The reporting currency of the Company is the U.S. dollar. The U.S. dollar is the functional currency for all subsidiaries, and therefore, foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities are remeasured into U.S. dollars at exchange rates at the balance sheet date, and foreign currency denominated non-monetary assets and liabilities are remeasured into U.S. dollars at historical exchange rates. Gains or losses from foreign currency remeasurement and settlements are included in other income (expense), net in the consolidated statements of operations. Net foreign exchange losses were not material for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 , and $ 2.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. Cash and Cash Equivalents The Company considers all highly liquid investments, including money market funds, U.S. treasury securities, U.S. agency obligations, commercial paper, and time deposits with remaining maturities at the date of purchase of three months or less, to be cash equivalents. Marketable Securities The Company\u2019s marketable securities consist of corporate notes and bonds, commercial paper, U.S. agency obligations, U.S. treasury securities, and time deposits. The Company determines the appropriate classification of its marketable securities at the time of purchase and reevaluates such determination at each balance sheet date. The Company has classified and accounted for its marketable securities as available-for-sale securities. The Company may sell these securities at any time for use in its current operations or for other purposes, even prior to maturity. As a result, the Company classifies its marketable securities within current assets. Available-for-sale securities are recorded at fair value each reporting period, and are adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts to maturity and such amortization and accretion are included in other income (expense), net in the consolidated statements of operations. Realized gains and losses are determined based on the specific identification method and are reported in other income (expense), net in the consolidated statements of operations. Unrealized gains are reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) on the consolidated balance sheets until realized. For available-for-sale debt securities in an unrealized loss position, the Company first assesses whether it intends to sell the security or it is more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell the security before the recovery of its entire amortized cost basis. If either of these criteria is met, the security\u2019s amortized cost basis is written down to fair value through other income (expense), net in the consolidated statements of operations. If neither of these criteria is met, the Company evaluates whether the decline in fair value below amortized cost is due to credit or non-credit related factors. In making this assessment, the Company considers the extent to which fair value is less than amortized cost, any changes to the rating of the security by a rating agency, and any adverse conditions specifically related to the security, among other factors. Credit related unrealized losses are recognized as an allowance for expected credit losses of available-for-sale debt securities on the consolidated balance sheets with a corresponding charge in other income (expense), net in the consolidated statements of operations. Non-credit related unrealized losses are included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). Fair Value of Financial Instruments Fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. The accounting guidance establishes a three-tiered hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in the valuation methodologies in measuring fair value as follows: \u2022 Level 1 Inputs: Observable inputs such as unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities at the measurement date. \u2022 Level 2 Inputs: Observable inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1, such as quoted prices in less active markets or model-derived valuations that are observable either directly or indirectly. \u2022 Level 3 Inputs: Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities. The Company\u2019s financial instruments consist of cash equivalents, marketable securities, accounts receivable, accounts payable, accrued expenses, derivative instruments, and convertible senior notes. Cash equivalents and marketable securities are recorded at fair value. Accounts receivable, accounts payable, and accrued expenses are stated at their carrying value, which approximates fair value due to the short time to the expected receipt or payment date. See Note 4 for further details regarding the fair value of the Company\u2019s derivative instruments and convertible senior notes. Accounts Receivable and Allowance for Credit Losses Accounts receivable on the consolidated balance sheets consists of trade accounts receivable and unbilled receivables, net of an allowance for expected credit losses. Trade accounts receivable are stated at the invoiced amount and consist of amounts currently due from customers. Unbilled receivables represent revenue recognized in excess of invoiced amounts for the Company\u2019s unconditional right to consideration in exchange for goods or services that the Company has transferred to the customer, such that only the passage of time is required before payment of consideration is due. The unbilled receivables balance was $ 130.7 million and $ 64.2 million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Accounts receivable are reduced by an allowance for expected credit losses. The allowance for expected credits losses represents the best estimate of lifetime expected credit losses against the existing accounts receivable, inclusive of unbilled receivables, based on certain factors including the age of the receivable balance, past collection experience with the customer, historical write-off experience, credit quality of the customer, current economic conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts of future economic conditions. Accounts receivable deemed uncollectible are written off against the allowance for expected credit losses when identified and the Company no longer actively pursues collection of the receivable. The Company\u2019s allowance for expected credit losses was not material as of December 31, 2024 and 2023. Additions to and write-offs against the allowance for expected credit losses were not material for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022 . Derivative Instruments and Hedging The Company enters into foreign currency forward contracts with certain financial institutions to mitigate the impact of foreign currency fluctuations on future cash flows and earnings. Derivative instruments that hedge the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows are designated as cash flow hedges. The Company records changes in the fair value of these derivatives as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) (\u201cAOCI\u201d) and subsequently reclassifies the related gains or losses into cost of revenue or operating expense in the same period, or periods, during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. The Company evaluates the effectiveness of its cash flow hedges on a quarterly basis and does not exclude any component of the changes in fair value of the derivative instruments for effectiveness testing purposes. The Company classifies cash flows related to its cash flow hedges as operating activities in its consolidated statements of cash flows. Derivative instruments that hedge the exposure to variability in the fair value of assets or liabilities or hedge monetary assets and liabilities denominated in certain foreign currencies are not designated as hedges for financial reporting purposes. The Company records changes in the fair value of these derivatives in other income (expense), net in the consolidated statements of operations. The Company classifies cash flows related to these derivatives as operating activities in its consolidated statements of cash flows. The Company has master netting agreements with each of its counterparties, which permit net settlement of multiple, separate derivative contracts with a single payment. The Company does not have collateral requirements with any of its counterparties. Although the Company is allowed to present the fair value of derivative instruments on a net basis according to master netting arrangements, the Company has elected to present its derivative instruments on a gross basis in the consolidated financial statements. The Company\u2019 s derivative instruments generally have maturities of 18 months or less. The Company does not use derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes. Concentration of Risks Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk are primarily cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities, accounts receivable, and derivative instruments. The primary focus of the Company\u2019s investment strategy is to preserve capital and meet liquidity requirements. The Company invests its excess cash in highly rated money market funds and in marketable securities. The Company extends credit to customers in the normal course of business. The Company maintains an allowance for expected credit losses on customers\u2019 accounts when deemed necessary. The Company mitigates its counterparty credit risk related to derivative instruments by transacting with major financial institutions with high credit ratings. No customer represented 10 % or greater of total revenue for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022 . No customer represented 10 % or greater of gross accounts receivable as of December 31, 2024 and 2023 . Deferred Contract Acquisition Costs The Company capitalizes incremental costs of obtaining a contract with a customer if such costs are recoverable. Such costs primarily consist of sales commissions earned by the Company\u2019s sales force and the associated payroll taxes. Sales commissions for new revenue contracts, including incremental sales to existing customers, are deferred and then amortized over an estimated period of benefit, which the Company has determined to be one to five years. To determine the period of benefit, the Company has considered its technology development cycle, the cadence of software releases, the nature of its customer contracts, the duration of customer relationships, and the expected renewal period. Sales commissions for renewal contracts (which are not considered commensurate with sales commissions for new revenue contracts and incremental sales to existing customers) are deferred and then amortized over the renewal contract term. Amortization of deferred contract acquisition costs is included in sales and marketing expenses in the consolidated statements of operations. The Company periodically reviews the carrying amount of deferred contract acquisition costs to determine whether events or changes in circumstances have occurred that could impact the period of benefit of these deferred costs. The Company did no t recognize any impairment of deferred contract acquisition costs during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022 . Capitalized Software Costs Software development costs for software to be sold, leased, or otherwise marketed are expensed as incurred until the establishment of technological feasibility, at which time those costs are capitalized until the product is available for general release to customers and amortized over the estimated life of the product. Technological feasibility is established upon the completion of a working prototype that has been certified as having no critical bugs and is a release candidate. Costs to develop software that is marketed externally have no t been capitalized as the current software development process is essentially completed concurrently with the establishment of technological feasibility and were not material for the periods presented. As such, all related software development costs are expensed as incurred and included in research and development expenses in the consolidated statements of operations. Costs related to software acquired, developed, or modified solely to meet the Company\u2019s internal requirements are capitalized. Costs incurred during the preliminary planning and evaluation stage of the project and during the post-implementation operational stage are expensed as incurred. Costs incurred during the application development stage of the project are capitalized within property and equipment, net on the consolidated balance sheets. Amortization is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the capitalized software asset, which is generally three to five years . The amortization of internal-use software costs is included in cost of revenue in the consolidated statements of operations. The Company evaluates the useful life of these assets on a periodic basis and tests for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances occur that could impact the recoverability of these assets. The Company did no t recognize any impairment of capitalized internal-use software costs during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022 . Property and Equipment, Net Property and equipment are stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Repairs and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred. The estimated lives of the Company\u2019s assets are as follows:\nUseful Lives\nComputers, equipment, and software 3 years\nFurniture and fixtures 5 years\nLeasehold improvements Shorter of the remaining lease term or useful life The Company periodically reviews the remaining estimated useful lives of its property and equipment. If the estimated useful life assumption for any asset is changed due to new information, the remaining unamortized balance would be depreciated or amortized over the revised estimated useful life on a prospective basis. Upon retirement or sale, the cost of assets disposed of and the related accumulated depreciation and amortization are removed from the consolidated financial statements and any resulting gain or loss is reflected in the consolidated statements of operations. There were no material gains or losses incurred as a result of retirement or sale during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022 . Leases Leases arise from contractual obligations that convey the right to control the use of identified property, plant or equipment for a period of time in exchange for consideration. The Company determines if a contract is, or contains, a lease at contract inception. All of the Company\u2019s leases are operating leases and are included in operating lease right-of-use assets, operating lease liabilities, and operating lease liabilities, non-current on the consolidated balance sheets. The Company accounts for lease components and non-lease components as a single lease component for all leases. The Company has elected an accounting policy to not recognize short-term leases, which have a lease term of twelve months or less, on the consolidated balance sheets. Operating lease right-of-use assets and operating lease liabilities are recognized at the lease commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term discounted using the Company\u2019s incremental borrowing rate. Operating lease right-of-use assets also include any lease payments made and exclude lease incentives. As the Company\u2019s leases do not provide an implicit rate, the incremental borrowing rate used is estimated based on what the Company would have to pay on a collateralized basis in the currency in which the arrangement is denominated over a similar term as the lease. Lease payments include fixed payments and variable payments based on an index or rate, if any, and are recognized as lease expense on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. The lease term includes options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain they will be exercised. Variable lease payments not based on a rate or index are expensed as incurred. Business Combinations When the Company acquires a business, the purchase consideration is allocated to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their estimated acquisition date fair values. The excess of the purchase consideration over the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, if any, is recorded as goodwill. Determining the fair value of intangible assets requires the use of estimates including, but not limited to, the selection of valuation methodologies, time and resources required to recreate the assets a cquired, and selection of comparable companies. The Company\u2019s estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and, as a result, actual results may differ from estimates. During the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition date, the Company may record adjustments to the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period, any subsequent adjustments are recorded in the consolidated statement of operations. Impairment of Goodwill, Intangible Assets, and Other Long-Lived Assets The Company evaluates the recoverability of long-lived assets, including property and equipment, operating lease right-of-use assets, and acquired intangible assets, for possible impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be fully recoverable. Recoverability of these assets is measured by a comparison of the carrying amounts to the undiscounted future cash flows the assets are expected to generate. If the carrying amount exceeds the undiscounted future cash flows, the carrying amount of such assets is reduced to fair value. There were no impairment charges related to long-lived assets during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022. Goodwill is not amortized but rather tested for impairment at least annually in the fourth quarter or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Goodwill impairment is recognized when the quantitative assessment results in the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeding its fair value, in which case an impairment charge is recorded to the extent the carrying value exceeds the fair value, limited to the amount of goodwill. There were no goodwill impairment charges during years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 . Convertible Senior Notes The Company accounts for its convertible senior notes wholly as debt. Debt issuance costs incurred in connection with the issuance of the Company\u2019s convertible senior notes are reflected in the consolidated balance sheets as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of the outstanding convertible senior notes. These costs are amortized as interest expense using the effective interest rate method over the contractual term of the convertible senior notes and is included within other income (expense) , net on the consolidated statements of operations. Deferred Revenue Deferred revenue, which is a contract liability, primarily consists of customer billings or payments received in advance of revenue being recognized from the Company\u2019s subscription and services contracts. The Company generally invoices customers annually in advance for its term-based licenses and typically annually in advance or monthly in arrears for its SaaS offering. Typical payment terms range from net 30 to net 60 days of the invoice date. Deferred revenue that is anticipated to be recognized during the succeeding twelve-month period is recorded as deferred revenue within current liabilities and the remaining portion is recorded as deferred revenue, non-current. The Company records deferred revenue upon the right to invoice or when payments have been received for subscriptions or services not delivered. Deferred revenue does not necessarily represent the total contract value of the related agreements. Revenue Recognition The Company generates revenue from the sale of subscriptions and services. Subscription revenue consists of subscriptions to Confluent Cloud, a fully-managed SaaS offering that is entirely cloud-native, Confluent Platform, a self-managed offering for on-premise deployments, and WarpStream, a BYOC managed streaming service where the raw data resides inside a customer\u2019s own cloud environment. Confluent Cloud and WarpStream customers may purchase subscriptions either without a commitment contract on a month-to-month basis, which the Company refers to as pay-as-you-go, or under a usage-based commitment contract of at least one year in duration, in which customers commit to specified per-usage rates. Revenue from the Company\u2019s pay-as-you-go and WarpStream arrangements were immaterial portions of subscription revenue during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022. The Company primarily enters into subscription contracts with one-year terms, and subscription contracts are generally non-cancelable and non-refundable, although customers can terminate for breach if the Company materially fails to perform. Services revenue consists of revenue from professional services and education services. The Company generates sales of its subscriptions and services through its sales teams, self-service channel, and partner ecosystem, including the major cloud provider marketplaces. The consolidated financial statements reflect the Company\u2019s accounting for revenue in accordance with ASC Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (\u201cASC 606\u201d). Under ASC 606, the Company recognizes revenue when its customers obtain control of promised subscriptions or services in an amount that reflects the consideration that the Company expects to receive in exchange for those subscriptions or services. In determining the appropriate amount of revenue to be recognized as the Company fulfills its obligations under each of its agreements, the following steps are performed: (i) identification of the contract with a customer The Company generally contracts with customers through order forms, which are governed by master sales agreements, and through cloud provider marketplaces. The Company determines that it has a contract with a customer when the contract is approved, each party\u2019s rights regarding the subscriptions or services to be transferred and the payment terms for the services can be identified, the Company has determined the customer has the ability and intent to pay, and the contract has commercial substance. The Company applies judgment in determining the customer\u2019s ability and intent to pay, which is based on a variety of factors, including the customer\u2019s historical payment experience or, in the case of a new customer, credit, financial, or other information pertaining to the customer. When a contract is entered into, the Company evaluates whether the contract is part of a larger arrangement and should be accounted for with other contracts and whether the combined or single contract includes more than one performance obligation. (ii) identification of the performance obligations in the contract Performance obligations are identified based on the subscriptions and services that will be transferred to the customer that are both (1) capable of being distinct, whereby the customer can benefit from the subscriptions or services either on their own or together with other resources that are readily available from third parties or from the Company, and (2) distinct in the context of the contract, whereby the transfer of the subscriptions and services is separately identifiable from other promises in the contract. Where applicable, the Company also identifies material rights as performance obligations. To the extent a contract includes multiple promised subscriptions or services, the Company applies judgment to determine whether promised subscriptions or services are capable of being distinct and distinct in the context of the contract. If these criteria are not met, or if performance obligations follow the same pattern of recognition, the promised subscriptions or services are accounted for as a combined performance obligation. The Company has concluded that its contracts with customers do not contain warranties that give rise to a separate performance obligation. (iii) measurement of the transaction price The transaction price is the total amount of consideration the Company expects to be entitled to in exchange for the subscriptions and services in a contract. The transaction price in a usage-based SaaS contract is typically equal to the commitment in the contract, less any discounts provided. Variable consideration is included in the transaction price if, in the Company\u2019s judgment, it is probable that a significant future reversal of cumulative revenue under the contract will not occur. The vast majority of Company\u2019s contracts do not contain a material significant financing component. (iv) allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations; If a contract contains a single performance obligation, the entire transaction price is allocated to the single performance obligation. For contracts that contain multiple performance obligations, the Company allocates the transaction price using a relative SSP allocation based on the SSPs of each performance obligation. Determining the relative SSP for contracts that contain multiple performance obligations is a critical accounting estimate. The Company establishes each SSP based on multiple factors, including prices at which the Company separately sells standalone subscriptions and services. In cases where directly observable standalone sales are not available, such as when license and PCS are not sold on a standalone basis, the Company establishes SSP by using information such as historical selling price of performance obligations in similar transactions, market conditions, and the Company\u2019s pricing practices, which can require significant judgment and are subject to change based on continuous reevaluation. There may be more than one SSP for individual subscriptions and services due to the stratification of subscription support tiers and services. The Company also considers if there are any additional material rights inherent in a contract, and if so, it allocates revenue to the material right as a performance obligation. (v) recognition of revenue when the Company satisfies each performance obligation; The Company recognizes revenue at the time the related performance obligation is satisfied, in an amount that reflects the consideration it expects to be entitled to in exchange for those subscriptions or services. The Company records its revenue net of any withholding, value added or sales tax, as well as any discounts or marketing development funds. Subscription Revenue The Company\u2019s subscription revenue includes revenue from Confluent Cloud and WarpStream for its usage-based commitment contracts and pay-as-you-go arrangements, which is recognized on a usage basis, as usage represents a direct measurement of the value to the customer of the subscription transferred as of a particular date relative to the total value to be delivered over the term of the contract. The Company\u2019s subscription revenue also includes revenue from Confluent Platform for term-based licenses sold in conjunction with post-contract customer support, maintenance, and upgrades, referred to together as PCS. The license provides the right to use licensed proprietary software features, which represents significant standalone functionality and is therefore deemed a distinct performance obligation. License revenue is recognized at a point in time, upon delivery and transfer of control of the underlying license to the customer, which is typically the effective start date. Revenue from PCS is based on its continuous pattern of transfer to the customer and therefore is recognized ratably over the contract term. Services Revenue The Company\u2019s services revenue includes revenue from professional services and education services, which are generally sold on a time-and-materials basis. The Company recognizes the associated revenue as services are delivered. Cost of Revenue Cost of Subscription Revenue Cost of subscription revenue primarily includes personnel-related costs, including salaries, bonuses, benefits, and stock-based compensation, for employees associated with customer support and maintenance, third-party cloud infrastructure costs, amortization of internal-use software and acquired intangible assets, and allocated overhead. Cost of Services Revenue Cost of services revenue primarily includes personnel-related costs, including salaries, bonuses, benefits, and stock-based compensation, for employees associated with professional services and education services, costs of third-party consultants and partners who supplement our services delivery team , and allocated overhead. Research and Development Costs Research and development costs are expensed as incurred and consist primarily of personnel-related costs, including salaries, bonuses, benefits, and stock-based compensation, net of amounts capitalized, third-party cloud infrastructure expenses incurred in developing the Company\u2019s offering, software and subscription services dedicated for use by the Company\u2019s research and development organization, contractor and professional services fees, and allocated overhead. Advertising Costs Advertising costs are expensed as incurred or when the advertising first takes place, based on the nature of the advertising, and are recorded in sales and marketing expenses in the consolidated statements of operations. Advertising expense was $ 31.5 million, $ 27.7 million, and $ 28.7 million, for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022 , respectively. Stock-Based Compensation The Company records compensation expense in connection with all stock-based awards, including stock options and restricted stock units (\u201cRSUs\u201d) granted to employees and non-employees and stock pur"

        "8. Convertible Senior Notes In December 2021, the Company issued $ 1.1 billion aggregate principal amount of 0 % convertible senior notes due 2027 (the \u201c2027 Notes\u201d), including the exercise in full of the initial purchasers\u2019 option to purchase up to an additional $ 100.0 million principal amount of the 2027 Notes, in a private placement to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act. The 2027 Notes are general unsecured obligations of the Company and will mature on January 15, 2027, unless earlier converted, redeemed, or repurchased. The 2027 Notes do not bear regular interest, and the principal amount of the 2027 Notes will not accrete. Special interest, if any, is payable semiannually in arrears on January 15 and July 15 of each year, beginning on July 15, 2022 (if and to the extent that special interest is then payable on the 2027 Notes). No special interest has been paid in connection with the 2027 Notes to date. The total net proceeds from the offering, after deducting initial purchasers\u2019 discounts and debt issuance costs, were $ 1,080.5 million. The initial conversion rate is 9.9936 shares of the Company\u2019s Class A common stock per $1,000 principal amount of 2027 Notes (equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $ 100.06 per share of the Company\u2019s Class A common stock), subject to adjustment as set forth in the indenture governing the 2027 Notes (the \u201cIndenture\u201d). The 2027 Notes are convertible at the option of the holders at any time prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding October 15, 2026, only under the following conditions: (1) during any calendar quarter commencing after the calendar quarter ending on March 31, 2022 (and only during such calendar quarter), if the last reported sale price of the Company\u2019s Class A common stock for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during a period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on, and including, the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter is greater than or equal to 130 % of the conversion price for the 2027 Notes on each applicable trading day; (2) during the five business day period after any ten consecutive trading day period (the \u201cmeasurement period\u201d) in which the trading price per $ 1,000 principal amount of the 2027 Notes for each trading day of the measurement period was less than 98 % of the product of the last reported sale price of the Company\u2019s Class A common stock and the conversion rate for the 2027 Notes on each such trading day; (3) if the Company calls such 2027 Notes for redemption, at any time prior to the close of business on the scheduled trading day immediately preceding the redemption date, but only with respect to the 2027 Notes called (or deemed called) for redemption; or (4) upon the occurrence of specified corporate events as set forth in the Indenture. On or after October 15, 2026, until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date, holders of the 2027 Notes may convert all or any portion of their 2027 Notes at any time, at the option of the holder regardless of the foregoing conditions. Upon conversion, the Company may satisfy its conversion obligation by paying or delivering, as the case may be, cash, shares of Class A common stock or a combination of cash and shares of Class A common stock, at the Company\u2019s election, in the manner and subject to the terms and conditions provided in the Indenture. In addition, following certain corporate events that occur prior to the maturity date of the 2027 Notes or if the Company delivers a notice of redemption in respect of the 2027 Notes, the Company will, under certain circumstances, increase the conversion rate of the 2027 Notes for a holder who elects to convert its 2027 Notes in connection with such a corporate event or convert its 2027 Notes called (or deemed called) for redemption in connection with such notice of redemption, as the case may be. During the year ended December 31, 2024, the conditions allowing holders of the 2027 Notes to convert have not been met. The 2027 Notes were therefore not convertible and were classified as long-term debt on the Company\u2019s consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2024. The Company may not redeem the 2027 Notes prior to January 20, 2025. The Company may redeem for cash all or any portion of the 2027 Notes (subject to the certain limitations described in the Indenture), at its option, on or after January 20, 2025, if the last reported sale price of the Company\u2019s Class A common stock has been at least 130 % of the conversion price for the 2027 Notes then in effect for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during any 30 consecutive trading day period (including the last trading day of such period) ending on, and including, the trading day immediately preceding the date on which the Company provides notice of redemption at a redemption price equal to 100 % of the principal amount of the 2027 Notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid special interest, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date. If the Company redeems less than all of the outstanding 2027 Notes, at least $ 100.0 million aggregate principal amount of 2027 Notes must be outstanding and not subject to redemption as of, and after giving effect to, delivery of the relevant notice of redemption. No sinking fund is provided for the 2027 Notes. The Company incurred $ 19.5 million of debt issuance costs related to the 2027 Notes. These costs are amortized to interest expense included within other income (expense), net on the consolidated statements of operations over the contractual term of the 2027 Notes at an effective interest rate of 0.35 %. Amortization of debt issuance costs was $ 3.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022. The net carrying amount of the 2027 Notes was as follows (in thousands):\nDecember 31, 2024 December 31, 2023\nPrincipal $ 1,100,000 $ 1,100,000\nUnamortized debt issuance costs ( 7,851 ) ( 11,687 )\nNet carrying amount $ 1,092,149 $ 1,088,313 Capped Calls In connection with the pricing of the 2027 Notes and the exercise in full by the initial purchasers of their option to purchase additional 2027 Notes, the Company entered into capped call transactions with certain of the initial purchasers of the 2027 Notes or their respective affiliates and other financial institutions (the \u201cCapped Calls\u201d). The Capped Calls each have an initial strike price of approximately $ 100.06 per share, subject to certain adjustments, which corresponds to the initial conversion price of the 2027 Notes. The Capped Calls have initial cap prices of $ 138.02 per share, subject to certain adjustments. The Capped Calls associated with the 2027 Notes cover, subject to anti-dilution adjustments, approximately 11.0 million shares of the Company\u2019s Class A common stock. The Capped Calls are expected generally to reduce the potential dilution to the Company\u2019s Class A common stock upon any conversion of the 2027 Notes and/or offset any cash payments the Company is required to make in excess of the principal amount of converted 2027 Notes, as the case may be, with such reduction and/or offset subject to a cap based on the cap price. For accounting purposes, the Capped Calls are separate transactions and not part of the terms of the 2027 Notes. As these transactions meet certain accounting criteria, the Capped Calls are recorded in stockholders\u2019 equity and are not accounted for as derivatives. The cost of $ 91.0 million incurred to purchase the Capped Calls was recorded as a reduction to additional paid-in capital and will not be remeasured."

        "9. Commitments and Contingencies Leases The Company has entered into non-cancelable operating leases, primarily for the rent of office space expiring at various dates through 2029. Certain lease agreements contain an option for the Company to renew the lease for a term of up to five years or an option to terminate the lease early within three years of lease termination . The Company considers these options in determining the lease term and minimum lease payments on a lease-by-lease basis. None of the Company\u2019s lease agreements contain any material non-lease components, material residual value guarantees, or material restrictive covenants. In 2019, the Company was issued a letter of credit of $ 8.2 million for its office space in Mountain View, California. The letter of credit was reduced to $ 6.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2024. No draws have been made under the letter of credit as of December 31, 2024 and 2023. In addition, the Company subleased certain floors of its unoccupied office space that expired at various dates in 2022. Sublease income was recorded as a reduction of lease expense and was not material for the year ended December 31, 2022. There was no sublease income during the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023. For the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022 , lease expense, net of sublease income of $ 4.9 million, $ 20.9 million, and $ 10.1 million is included in operating expenses in the consolidated statements of operations, respectively. Lease expense for the year ended December 31, 2023 includes $ 15.7 million of lease abandonment charges related to the cease use of certain leased office space recorded within restructuring and other related charges in the consolidated statements of operations. See Note 12 for further information on the Company\u2019s restructuring actions. The Company did not have any material variable lease costs or short-term lease costs for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022. C ash paid for amounts included in the measurement of operating lease liabilities was $ 11.1 million, $ 8.7 million, and $ 10.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively.

Stockholders\u2019 Equity Preferred Stock In connection with its IPO, the Company\u2019s amended and restated certificate of incorporation became effective, which authorized the issuance of 10,000,000 shares of undesignated preferred stock with a par value of $ 0.00001 per share with rights and preferences, including voting rights, designated from time to time by the board of directors. Common Stock The Company has two classes of common stock: Class A common stock and Class B common stock. In connection with its IPO, the Company\u2019s amended and restated certificate of incorporation authorized the issuance of 1,000,000,000 shares of Class A common stock and 500,000,000 shares of Class B common stock. The shares of Class A common stock and Class B common stock are identical, except with respect to voting, converting, and transfer rights. Each share of Class A common stock is entitled to one vote. Each share of Class B common stock is entitled to ten votes. Class A and Class B common stock have a par value of $ 0.00001 per share and are referred to as common stock throughout the notes to the consolidated financial statements, unless otherwise noted. Holders of common stock are entitled to receive any dividends as may be declared from time to time by the board of directors. Each share of Class B common stock is convertible at any time at the option of the holder into one share of Class A common stock. Any holder\u2019s shares of Class B common stock will convert automatically to Class A common stock, on a one-to-one basis, upon the following: (i) sale or transfer of such share of Class B common stock, except for permitted transfers as described in the amended and restated certificate of incorporation; (ii) the death or incapacity of the Class B common stockholder (or nine months after the date of the death or incapacity if the stockholder is one of the Company\u2019s founders); and (iii) on the final conversion date, defined as the earliest of (a) the date fixed by our board of directors that is no less than 61 days and no more than 180 days following the date on which the outstanding shares of Class B common stock represent less than 10 % of the then outstanding shares of Class A and Class B common stock; (b) the last trading day of the fiscal year following the tenth anniversary of the Company\u2019s IPO; or (c) the date specified by a vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Class B common stock, voting as a single class. Common Stock Reserved for Future Issuance The Company has reserved the following shares of common stock for future issuance:\nDecember 31, 2024 December 31, 2023\n2014 Stock Plan:\nOptions outstanding 23,142,966 31,112,073\nRestricted stock units outstanding 277,960 1,042,303\n2021 Equity Incentive Plan:\nOptions outstanding 22,500 22,500\nRestricted stock units outstanding 20,277,922 22,650,063\nRemaining shares available for future issuance 44,279,867 37,289,144\n2021 Employee Stock Purchase Plan 10,139,193 8,166,130\nTotal 98,140,408 100,282,213 Equity Incentive Plans In September 2014, the Company\u2019s board of directors adopted and the Company\u2019s stockholders approved the 2014 Stock Plan (the \u201c2014 Plan\u201d). The 2014 Plan was also amended and restated in March 2021 and June 2021. Under the 2014 Plan, the board of directors may grant stock options and other equity-based awards to eligible employees, directors, and consultants. The 2014 Plan was terminated in June 2021 in connection with the IPO, but continues to govern the terms of outstanding awards that were granted prior to the termination of the 2014 Plan. No further equity awards will be granted under the 2014 Plan. With the establishment of the 2021 Equity Incentive Plan (the \u201c2021 Plan\u201d), upon the expiration, forfeiture, cancellation, or reacquisition of any shares of Class B common stock underlying outstanding stock-based awards granted under the 2014 Plan, an equal number of shares of Class A common stock will become available for grant under the 2021 Plan. Equity-based awards granted under the 2014 Plan and the 2021 Plan generally vest over two to four years. All stock option grants expire ten years from the date of grant. In April 2021, the Company\u2019s board of directors adopted, and in June 2021, the Company\u2019s stockholders approved, the 2021 Plan, which became effective at the time of the execution of the underwriting agreement related to the Company\u2019s IPO. The 2021 Plan provides for the grant of incentive stock options, nonqualified stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock awards, restricted stock units awards, performance awards, and other forms of awards to employees, directors, and consultants, including employees and consultants of the Company\u2019s affiliates. A total of 25,812,876 shares of the Company\u2019s Class A common stock have been reserved for future issuance under the 2021 Plan in addition to (i) the shares that remained available for grant of future awards under the 2014 Plan at the time the 2021 Plan became effective, (ii) shares underlying outstanding stock awards granted under the 2014 Plan that expire, or are forfeited, cancelled, or reacquired, as described above, and (iii) any automatic increases in the number of shares of Class A common stock reserved for future issuance under this plan. On January 1, 2024, the shares available for grant under the 2021 Plan were automatically increased by 15,575,577 shares pursuant to the 2021 Plan. In April 2021, the Company\u2019s board of directors adopted, and in June 2021, the Company\u2019s stockholders approved, the 2021 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the \u201c2021 ESPP\u201d), which became effective at the time of the execution of the underwriting agreement related to the Company\u2019s IPO. The 2021 ESPP authorizes the issuance of shares of Class A common stock pursuant to purchase rights granted to employees. A total of 5,162,575 shares of the Company\u2019s Class A common stock have been reserved for future issuance under the 2021 ESPP, in addition to any automatic increases in the number of shares of Class A common stock reserved for future issuance under this plan. On January 1, 2024, the shares available for grant under the 2021 ESPP were automatically increased by 3,115,115 shares pursuant to the 2021 ESPP. Except for the initial offering period, the 2021 ESPP provides for 12-month offering periods generally beginning on February 16 and August 16 of each year, and each offering period consists of two six-month purchase periods. The price at which Class A common stock is purchased under the 2021 ESPP is equal to 85 % of the lesser of (1) the fair market value of the Company\u2019s Class A common stock on the offering date or (2) the fair market value of the Company\u2019s Class A common stock on the purchase date. The 2021 ESPP offers a rollover feature pursuant to which, if the fair market value of a share of Class A common stock on the first trading day of a new purchase period is lower than the fair market value on the offering date, that offering period will terminate and participants will be automatically enrolled in a new 12-month offering period. ESPP rollovers occurred in August 2022, February 2023, and August 2024, which triggered new 12-month offering periods. The rollovers were accounted for as a modification to the original offering and res ulted in incremental stock-based compensation expense to be recognized over the remaining requisite service periods. The incremental stock-based compensation was not material for the August 2022 and February 2023 rollovers, and $ 4.3 million for the August 2024 rollover. Equity Awards Outstanding The following table summarizes stock equity award activity and activity regarding shares available for grant under the 2014 Plan and the 2021 Plan:\nEquity Awards Outstanding\nShares Available for Grant Outstanding Weighted-Average Weighted-Average Remaining Contractual Term (in years) Aggregate Intrinsic Value (in thousands)\nBalance as of December 31, 2023 37,289,144 31,134,573 $ 7.98 6.01 $ 480,766\nIncrease in authorized shares 15,575,577 - $ -\nStock options exercised - ( 7,454,089 ) $ 7.57\nStock options forfeited or expired 515,018 ( 515,018 ) $ 14.60\nRSUs granted ( 13,016,264 ) - $ -\nRSUs forfeited or cancelled 3,916,392 - $ -\nBalance as of December 31, 2024 44,279,867 23,165,466 $ 7.97 4.95 $ 463,750\nVested as of December 31, 2024 22,187,929 $ 7.81 4.93 $ 447,688\nVested and expected to vest as of December 31, 2024 23,165,466 $ 7.97 4.95 $ 463,750 Aggregate intrinsic value represents the difference between the exercise price of the options to purchase common stock and the estimated fair value of the Company\u2019s common stock. The intrinsic value of options exercised was $ 153.1 million , $ 241.0 million , and $ 382.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022 , respectively. No options were granted during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022. The total grant-date fair value of stock options vested was $ 44.8 million , $ 62.8 million , and $ 108.1 million during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively. Early Exercised Options All stock option holders have the right to exercise unvested options, which are subject to a repurchase right held by the Company at the original exercise price in the event of voluntary or involuntary termination of employment of the stockholder. As of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , there were 8,173 and 135,013 shares that had been early exercised and were subject to repurchase, respectively. The proceeds related to early exercised options are recorded as liabilities within accrued expenses and other liabilities and other liabilities, non-current on the consolidated balance sheets until the options vest, at which point they are reclassified to equity. As of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , the liabilities for early exercised options subject to repurchase were no t material and $ 1.3 million , respectively. Shares issued for early exercised options are included in issued and outstanding shares as they are legally issued and outstanding, but are not deemed outstanding for accounting purposes until the shares vest. RSUs The following table summarizes RSU activity under the 2014 Plan and the 2021 Plan:\nRSUs Outstanding\nNumber of Shares Weighted-Average\nUnvested balance as of December 31, 2023 23,692,366 $ 28.44\nRSUs granted 13,016,264 $ 26.55\nRSUs vested ( 12,236,356 ) $ 28.49\nRSUs forfeited or cancelled ( 3,916,392 ) $ 29.70\nUnvested balance as of December 31, 2024 20,555,882 $ 26.97 The total grant-date fair value of RSUs vested was $ 348.5 million , $ 281.5 million , and $ 160.3 million during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively. Restricted Common Stock During the year ended December 31, 2024, in connection with the WarpStream Labs business combination discussed in Note 7 Business Combinations, the Company issued 397,436 shares of Class A common stock to certain employees of WarpStream Labs. These shares are subject to holdback arrangements, pursuant to which the vesting is subject to continued employment over three years and achievement of certain milestones. The $ 7.9 million fair value of these shares is accounted for as post-combination stock-based compensation expense using the accelerated attribution method over the requisite service period when it is probable the performance-based vesting condition will be achieved. As of December 31, 2024 , 397,436 shares remained unvested. Restricted common stock is included in issued and outstanding shares as they are legally issued and outstanding, but are not deemed outstanding for accounting purposes until the shares vest. Determination of Fair Value The Company estimates the fair value of stock options and ESPP rights using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, which is dependent upon several variables, such as the fair value of the Company\u2019s common stock, the expected option term, expected volatility of the Company\u2019s stock price over the expected term, expected risk-free interest rate over the expected option term, and expected dividend yield. Fair Value of Common Stock : Since the Company\u2019s IPO, the fair value of the Company\u2019s common stock is determined by the closing price, on the date of grant, of its Class A common stock, which is traded on the Nasdaq Global Select Market. Expected Term : For option grants subject to service-based vesting conditions only, the expected term represents the period that the Company\u2019s stock options are expected to be outstanding and is calculated using the simplified method for options that have only service-based vesting conditions. The simplified method deems the term to be the average of the time-to-vesting and the contractual life of the options. For other option grants, the Company estimates the expected term using historical data on employee exercises and post-vesting employment termination behavior, considering the contractual life of the award. Expected Volatility : Prior to July 2023, the expected volatility was derived from the average historical stock volatilities of public companies within the Company\u2019s industry that it considers to be comparable to its business, over a period equivalent to the expected term of the stock options, since the Company did not have a sufficient trading history of its common stock. Beginning in July 2023, the Company uses a weighted average volatility of its Class A common stock and the stocks of public companies within the Company\u2019s industry to develop its expected volatility assumption. Risk-Free Interest Rate : The Company bases the risk-free interest rate on the implied yield available on U.S. Treasury zero-coupon notes with maturities equivalent to the option\u2019s expected term. Expected Dividend Yield : The Company has not issued any dividends in its history and does not expect to issue dividends over the life of the options and therefore has estimated the dividend yield to be zero . The fair value of employee stock purchase rights for offerings under the 2021 ESPP were estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following weighted-average assumptions:\nYear Ended December 31,\n2024 2023 2022\nExpected term (in years) 0.50 - 1.00 0.49 - 1.00 0.49 - 1.00\nExpected volatility 51.3 % - 71.2 % 58.5 % - 79.7 % 55.0 % - 82.1 %\nRisk-free interest rate 4.5 % - 5.3 % 5.0 % - 5.5 % 0.7 % - 3.3 %\nExpected dividend yield 0 % 0 % 0 % Stock-Based Compensation Expense Total stock-based compensation expense was as follows (in thousands):\nYear Ended December 31,\n2024 2023 2022\nCost of revenue - subscription $ 27,133 $ 25,620 $ 23,136\nCost of revenue - services 9,306 11,096 9,253\nResearch and development 166,468 139,809 101,499\nSales and marketing 134,015 124,568 99,366\nGeneral and administrative 58,738 48,740 44,402\nStock-based compensation, net of amounts capitalized $ 395,660 $ 349,833 $ 277,656\nCapitalized stock-based compensation 19,891 17,943 7,544\nTotal stock-based compensation $ 415,551 $ 367,776 $ 285,200 As of December 31, 2024, there was $ 506.5 million of unrecognized stock-based compensation expense, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.8 years."

This foreign current tax expense is recorded within accrued expenses and other liabilities as of December 31, 2024 and other liabilities, non-current as of December 31, 2023 on the consolidated balance sheets. The Company recorded a U.S. deferred tax asset of $ 17.8 million from a step-up in the tax basis of the intellectual property. Based on available objective evidence, the Company believes it is more likely than not that the additional U.S. deferred tax asset will not be realizable and is therefore offset by a full valuation allowance as of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023. The Company\u2019s effective tax rate substantially differed from the federal statutory tax rate of 21 % partially due to the election to waive certain deductions subject to the Base Erosion and Anti-Abuse Tax (\u201cBEAT\u201d). The reconciliation of the income tax benefit computed at the federal statutory tax rate to the Company\u2019s provision for income taxes was as follows (in thousands):\nYear Ended December 31,\n2024 2023 2022\nIncome tax benefit computed at federal statutory rate $ ( 70,279 ) $ ( 85,401 ) $ ( 93,714 )\nForeign rate differential 5,539 2,107 2,668\nStock-based compensation expense 4,897 88 ( 14,145 )\nChange in valuation allowance 69,814 97,923 122,724\nResearch and development credits ( 17,895 ) ( 13,049 ) ( 11,581 )\nIntra-group transfer of acquired intellectual property - 26,358 -\nBEAT waiver election 13,125 - -\nNon-deductible expenses 5,662 4,495 -\nOther ( 459 ) 3,551 341\nProvision for income taxes $ 10,404 $ 36,072 $ 6,293 The significant components of net deferred tax balances were as follows (in thousands):\nDecember 31,\n2024 2023\nDeferred tax assets:\nNet operating loss carryforwards $ 356,996 $ 369,107\nCapitalized research and development costs 187,955 119,960\nTax credit carryforwards 87,616 63,096\nIntangible assets 37,729 17,791\nStock-based compensation expense 26,314 27,840\nAccruals and reserves 13,465 16,948\nOther 12,345 17,450\nTotal deferred tax assets 722,420 632,192\nLess: Valuation allowance ( 671,718 ) ( 587,738 )\nDeferred tax assets, net of valuation allowance 50,702 44,454\nDeferred tax liabilities:\nDeferred contract acquisition costs ( 28,152 ) ( 28,379 )\nProperty and equipment ( 17,912 ) ( 11,765 )\nOther ( 6,090 ) ( 5,486 )\nTotal deferred tax liabilities ( 52,154 ) ( 45,630 )\nNet deferred tax liabilities $ ( 1,452 ) $ ( 1,176 ) The Company recognizes a valuation allowance on its deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that some or all the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Due to a history of losses in the United States and United Kingdom, U.S. and U.K. deferred tax assets have been fully offset by a valuation allowance. The valuation allowance was $ 671.7 million as of December 31, 2024 and increased by $ 84.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2024 primarily due to increased capitalized research and development costs, tax credit carryforwards, and capitalized intangible asset costs. The valuation allowance was $ 587.7 million as of December 31, 2023 and increased by $ 126.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2023 primarily due to increased U.S. federal and state loss carryforwards, intangible assets, capitalized research and development costs, and tax credit carryforwards. Based on the Company\u2019s assessment of the U.K.\u2019s current income and anticipated future earnings, there is a reasonable possibility that the Company may have sufficient evidence to release a significant portion of the valuation allowance in the U.K. within the next 12 months. However, the Company\u2019s judgment regarding the U.K.\u2019s future earnings and the exact timing and amount of any U.K. valuation allowance release are subject to change due to many factors, including future market conditions, the ability to successfully execute its business plans, and the amount of stock-based compensation tax deductions available in the future. Release of the U.K. valuation allowance would result in the recognition of net deferred tax assets on the Company\u2019s consolidated balance sheet and would decrease income tax expense in the period the release is recorded. As of December 31, 2024 , the Company has accrued $ 2.7 million of deferred U.S. state income and foreign withholding taxes on amounts of non-U.S. earnings that the Company plans to repatriate. For the non-U.S. earnings the Company intends to indefinitely reinvest, the estimated amount of any incremental tax associated with such earnings is immaterial. As of December 31, 2024 , the Company had $ 1,403.6 million of federal net operating loss carryforwards and $ 560.8 million of state net operating loss carryforwards. The federal net operating loss carryforwards can be carried forward indefinitely, but are limited to 80% of annual taxable income. The state net operating loss carryforwards will begin to expire in 2025. As of December 31, 2024 , the Company had U.S. federal and state research tax credit carryforwards of $ 87.5 million and $ 38.0 million, respectively. The U.S. federal research tax credit carryforwards will begin to expire in 2038. The California research tax credit carryforwards can be carried forward indefinitely, while the research tax credit carryforwards for other states will begin to expire in 2026. As of December 31, 2024 , the Company had $ 58.9 million of foreign net operating loss carryforwards. These foreign net operating loss carryforwards have an indefinite life and do not expire. Under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and similar provisions of state law, utilization of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards may be subject to an annual limitation due to an ownership change. As of December 31, 2024, the Company assessed that its net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards will not expire solely due to Section 382 limitations. A reconciliation of the beginning and ending balances of total unrecognized tax benefits is as follows (in thousands):\nYear Ended December 31,\n2024 2023 2022\nBeginning balance $ 27,309 $ 18,914 $ 12,530\nGross increase for prior year tax positions 280 439 1\nGross decrease for prior year tax positions ( 252 ) ( 5 ) ( 860 )\nGross increase for current year tax positions 10,781 7,961 7,243\nEnding balance $ 38,118 $ 27,309 $ 18,914 As of December 31, 2024, the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits, if recognized, would not affect the Company\u2019s effective tax rate due to the existence of carryforwards and the valuation allowance in the United States and applicable U.S. state jurisdictions. The Company does not expect its gross unrecognized tax benefits to change significantly within the next 12 months. It is reasonably possible that certain unrecognized tax benefits may increase or decrease within the next 12 months due to tax examination changes, settlement activities, or the impact on recognition and measurement considerations related to the results of published tax cases or other similar activities. The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in benefit from income taxes in the consolidated statements of operations. There were no interest and penalties associated with unrecognized income tax benefits for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022. The Company\u2019s tax years from inception in 2014 through December 31, 2024 remain subject to examination by various jurisdictions."

Such estimates include, but are not limited to, the standalone selling price (\u201cSSP\u201d) for each distinct performance obligation included in customer contracts, deferred contract acquisition costs and their period of benefit, stock-based compensation expense, the fair value of acquired intangible assets, capitalization of internal-use software, estimated useful lives of long-lived assets, the incremental borrowing rate used to measure operating lease liabilities, and accounting for income taxes. The Company bases its estimates on historical and anticipated results, trends, and various other assumptions that it believes are reasonable under the circumstances.

The Company determines the appropriate classification of its marketable securities at the time of purchase and reevaluates such determination at each balance sheet date. The Company has classified and accounted for its marketable securities as available-for-sale securities. The Company may sell these securities at any time for use in its current operations or for other purposes, even prior to maturity. As a result, the Company classifies its marketable securities within current assets. Available-for-sale securities are recorded at fair value each reporting period, and are adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts to maturity and such amortization and accretion are included in other income (expense), net in the consolidated statements of operations. Realized gains and losses are determined based on the specific identification method and are reported in other income (expense), net in the consolidated statements of operations. Unrealized gains are reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) on the consolidated balance sheets until realized. For available-for-sale debt securities in an unrealized loss position, the Company first assesses whether it intends to sell the security or it is more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell the security before the recovery of its entire amortized cost basis. If either of these criteria is met, the security\u2019s amortized cost basis is written down to fair value through other income (expense), net in the consolidated statements of operations. If neither of these criteria is met, the Company evaluates whether the decline in fair value below amortized cost is due to credit or non-credit related factors. In making this assessment, the Company considers the extent to which fair value is less than amortized cost, any changes to the rating of the security by a rating agency, and any adverse conditions specifically related to the security, among other factors. Credit related unrealized losses are recognized as an allowance for expected credit losses of available-for-sale debt securities on the consolidated balance sheets with a corresponding charge in other income (expense), net in the consolidated statements of operations. Non-credit related unrealized losses are included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). "

The Company\u2019s financial instruments consist of cash equivalents, marketable securities, accounts receivable, accounts payable, accrued expenses, derivative instruments, and convertible senior notes. Cash equivalents and marketable securities are recorded at fair value. Accounts receivable, accounts payable, and accrued expenses are stated at their carrying value, which approximates fair value due to the short time to the expected receipt or payment date.

Accounts receivable deemed uncollectible are written off against the allowance for expected credit losses when identified and the Company no longer actively pursues collection of the receivable. The Company\u2019s allowance for expected credit losses was not material as of December 31, 2024 and 2023.

The Company records changes in the fair value of these derivatives as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) (\u201cAOCI\u201d) and subsequently reclassifies the related gains or losses into cost of revenue or operating expense in the same period, or periods, during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. The Company evaluates the effectiveness of its cash flow hedges on a quarterly basis and does not exclude any component of the changes in fair value of the derivative instruments for effectiveness testing purposes. The Company classifies cash flows related to its cash flow hedges as operating activities in its consolidated statements of cash flows. Derivative instruments that hedge the exposure to variability in the fair value of assets or liabilities or hedge monetary assets and liabilities denominated in certain foreign currencies are not designated as hedges for financial reporting purposes.

Technological feasibility is established upon the completion of a working prototype that has been certified as having no critical bugs and is a release candidate. Costs to develop software that is marketed externally have no t been capitalized as the current software development process is essentially completed concurrently with the establishment of technological feasibility and were not material for the periods presented.

All of the Company\u2019s leases are operating leases and are included in operating lease right-of-use assets, operating lease liabilities, and operating lease liabilities, non-current on the consolidated balance sheets. The Company accounts for lease components and non-lease components as a single lease component for all leases. The Company has elected an accounting policy to not recognize short-term leases, which have a lease term of twelve months or less, on the consolidated balance sheets. Operating lease right-of-use assets and operating lease liabilities are recognized at the lease commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term discounted using the Company\u2019s incremental borrowing rate. Operating lease right-of-use assets also include any lease payments made and exclude lease incentives. As the Company\u2019s leases do not provide an implicit rate, the incremental borrowing rate used is estimated based on what the Company would have to pay on a collateralized basis in the currency in which the arrangement is denominated over a similar term as the lease. Lease payments include fixed payments and variable payments based on an index or rate, if any, and are recognized as lease expense on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.

Recoverability of these assets is measured by a comparison of the carrying amounts to the undiscounted future cash flows the assets are expected to generate.

      "Deferred Revenue": [
        "Deferred Revenue Deferred revenue, which is a contract liability, primarily consists of customer billings or payments received in advance of revenue being recognized from the Company\u2019s subscription and services contracts. The Company generally invoices customers annually in advance for its term-based licenses and typically annually in advance or monthly in arrears for its SaaS offering. Typical payment terms range from net 30 to net 60 days of the invoice date. Deferred revenue that is anticipated to be recognized during the succeeding twelve-month period is recorded as deferred revenue within current liabilities and the remaining portion is recorded as deferred revenue, non-current. The Company records deferred revenue upon the right to invoice or when payments have been received for subscriptions or services not delivered. Deferred revenue does not necessarily represent the total contract value of the related agreements."

      "Revenue Recognition": [
        "Revenue Recognition The Company generates revenue from the sale of subscriptions and services. Subscription revenue consists of subscriptions to Confluent Cloud, a fully-managed SaaS offering that is entirely cloud-native, Confluent Platform, a self-managed offering for on-premise deployments, and WarpStream, a BYOC managed streaming service where the raw data resides inside a customer\u2019s own cloud environment. Confluent Cloud and WarpStream customers may purchase subscriptions either without a commitment contract on a month-to-month basis, which the Company refers to as pay-as-you-go, or under a usage-based commitment contract of at least one year in duration, in which customers commit to specified per-usage rates. Revenue from the Company\u2019s pay-as-you-go and WarpStream arrangements were immaterial portions of subscription revenue during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022. The Company primarily enters into subscription contracts with one-year terms, and subscription contracts are generally non-cancelable and non-refundable, although customers can terminate for breach if the Company materially fails to perform. Services revenue consists of revenue from professional services and education services. The Company generates sales of its subscriptions and services through its sales teams, self-service channel, and partner ecosystem, including the major cloud provider marketplaces. The consolidated financial statements reflect the Company\u2019s accounting for revenue in accordance with ASC Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (\u201cASC 606\u201d). Under ASC 606, the Company recognizes revenue when its customers obtain control of promised subscriptions or services in an amount that reflects the consideration that the Company expects to receive in exchange for those subscriptions or services. In determining the appropriate amount of revenue to be recognized as the Company fulfills its obligations under each of its agreements, the following steps are performed: (i) identification of the contract with a customer The Company generally contracts with customers through order forms, which are governed by master sales agreements, and through cloud provider marketplaces. The Company determines that it has a contract with a customer when the contract is approved, each party\u2019s rights regarding the subscriptions or services to be transferred and the payment terms for the services can be identified, the Company has determined the customer has the ability and intent to pay, and the contract has commercial substance. The Company applies judgment in determining the customer\u2019s ability and intent to pay, which is based on a variety of factors, including the customer\u2019s historical payment experience or, in the case of a new customer, credit, financial, or other information pertaining to the customer. When a contract is entered into, the Company evaluates whether the contract is part of a larger arrangement and should be accounted for with other contracts and whether the combined or single contract includes more than one performance obligation. (ii) identification of the performance obligations in the contract Performance obligations are identified based on the subscriptions and services that will be transferred to the customer that are both (1) capable of being distinct, whereby the customer can benefit from the subscriptions or services either on their own or together with other resources that are readily available from third parties or from the Company, and (2) distinct in the context of the contract, whereby the transfer of the subscriptions and services is separately identifiable from other promises in the contract. Where applicable, the Company also identifies material rights as performance obligations. To the extent a contract includes multiple promised subscriptions or services, the Company applies judgment to determine whether promised subscriptions or services are capable of being distinct and distinct in the context of the contract. If these criteria are not met, or if performance obligations follow the same pattern of recognition, the promised subscriptions or services are accounted for as a combined performance obligation. The Company has concluded that its contracts with customers do not contain warranties that give rise to a separate performance obligation. (iii) measurement of the transaction price The transaction price is the total amount of consideration the Company expects to be entitled to in exchange for the subscriptions and services in a contract. The transaction price in a usage-based SaaS contract is typically equal to the commitment in the contract, less any discounts provided. Variable consideration is included in the transaction price if, in the Company\u2019s judgment, it is probable that a significant future reversal of cumulative revenue under the contract will not occur. The vast majority of Company\u2019s contracts do not contain a material significant financing component. (iv) allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations; If a contract contains a single performance obligation, the entire transaction price is allocated to the single performance obligation. For contracts that contain multiple performance obligations, the Company allocates the transaction price using a relative SSP allocation based on the SSPs of each performance obligation. Determining the relative SSP for contracts that contain multiple performance obligations is a critical accounting estimate. The Company establishes each SSP based on multiple factors, including prices at which the Company separately sells standalone subscriptions and services. In cases where directly observable standalone sales are not available, such as when license and PCS are not sold on a standalone basis, the Company establishes SSP by using information such as historical selling price of performance obligations in similar transactions, market conditions, and the Company\u2019s pricing practices, which can require significant judgment and are subject to change based on continuous reevaluation. There may be more than one SSP for individual subscriptions and services due to the stratification of subscription support tiers and services. The Company also considers if there are any additional material rights inherent in a contract, and if so, it allocates revenue to the material right as a performance obligation. (v) recognition of revenue when the Company satisfies each performance obligation; The Company recognizes revenue at the time the related performance obligation is satisfied, in an amount that reflects the consideration it expects to be entitled to in exchange for those subscriptions or services. The Company records its revenue net of any withholding, value added or sales tax, as well as any discounts or marketing development funds. Subscription Revenue The Company\u2019s subscription revenue includes revenue from Confluent Cloud and WarpStream for its usage-based commitment contracts and pay-as-you-go arrangements, which is recognized on a usage basis, as usage represents a direct measurement of the value to the customer of the subscription transferred as of a particular date relative to the total value to be delivered over the term of the contract. The Company\u2019s subscription revenue also includes revenue from Confluent Platform for term-based licenses sold in conjunction with post-contract customer support, maintenance, and upgrades, referred to together as PCS. The license provides the right to use licensed proprietary software features, which represents significant standalone functionality and is therefore deemed a distinct performance obligation. License revenue is recognized at a point in time, upon delivery and transfer of control of the underlying license to the customer, which is typically the effective start date. Revenue from PCS is based on its continuous pattern of transfer to the customer and therefore is recognized ratably over the contract term. Services Revenue The Company\u2019s services revenue includes revenue from professional services and education services, which are generally sold on a time-and-materials basis. The Company recognizes the associated revenue as services are delivered."

        "Stock-Based Compensation The Company records compensation expense in connection with all stock-based awards, including stock options and restricted stock units (\u201cRSUs\u201d) granted to employees and non-employees and stock purchase rights granted under the Employee Stock Purchase Plan (\u201cESPP\u201d) to employees, based on the fair value of the awards granted. The Company uses the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to determine the fair value of stock options and ESPP rights on the dates of grant. Calculating the fair value of stock options and ESPP rights using the Black-Scholes model requires certain highly subjective inputs and assumptions including the fair value of the underlying common stock, the expected term of the stock option or ESPP right, and the expected volatility of the price of the Company\u2019s common stock. The fair value of each RSU is based on the fair value of the Company\u2019s common stock on the date of grant. For stock-based awards that vest based only on continuous service, stock-based compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period of two to four years . For awards with both a service-based and a performance-based vesting condition, stock-based compensation expense is recognized using the accelerated attribution method over the requisite service period, from the time it is probable that the vesting condition will be met through the time the service-based vesting condition has been achieved. The Company has also granted certain options containing a provision whereby vesting is accelerated upon a change in control; stock-based compensation expense for such options is recognized on a straight-line basis over a vesting period of generally four years, as a change in control is considered to be outside of the Company\u2019s control and is not considered probable until it occurs. Forfeitures are accounted for as they occur."

      "Income Taxes": [
        "Income Taxes Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax law in effect for the years in which the temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in the period that includes the enactment date. A valuation allowance is recorded for deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Accordingly, the need to establish such allowances is assessed periodically by considering matters such as future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, projected future taxable income, tax planning strategies, and results of recent operations. The Company evaluates and accounts for the benefits of uncertain tax positions using a two-step approach. Recognition, step one, occurs when the Company concludes that a tax position, based solely on its technical merits, is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination. Measurement, step two, determines the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50% likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. Changes in recognition or measurement are reflected in the period in which the change in judgment occurs. "

      "Net Loss Per Share": [
        "Net Loss Per Share The Company computes basic and diluted net loss per share attributable to Class A and Class B common stockholders using the two-class method required for companies with participating securities. The Company considers unvested common stock to be participating securities, as the holders of such securities have non-forfeitable dividend rights in the event that a dividend is paid on common stock. Basic net loss per share is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted-average number of shares outstanding during the period, excluding unvested common stock that is subject to repurchase and unvested restricted common stock. Basic and diluted net loss per share were the same for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, as the inclusion of all potentially dilutive shares was anti-dilutive due to the net loss reported for each period. The rights, including the liquidation and dividend rights, of the holders of Class A and Class B common stock are identical, except with respect to voting, converting, and transfer rights. As the liquidation and dividend rights are identical, the undistributed earnings are allocated on a proportionate basis to each class of common stock and the resulting basic and diluted net loss per share are, therefore, the same for both Class A and Class B common stock on an individual or combined basis."
