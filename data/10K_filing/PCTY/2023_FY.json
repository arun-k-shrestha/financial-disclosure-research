      "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies": [
        "(2) Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (a) Basis of Presentation, Consolidation, and Use of Estimates The accompanying consolidated financial statements of the Company have been prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the \u201cSEC\u201d). The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\u201cGAAP\u201d) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Future events and their effects cannot be predicted with certainty; accordingly, accounting estimates require the exercise of judgment. Accounting estimates used in the preparation of these consolidated financial statements may change as new events occur, as more experience is acquired, as additional information is obtained and as the operating environment changes. The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries. All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. (b) Concentrations of Risk The Company regularly maintains cash balances that exceed Federal Depository Insurance Corporation limits. No individual client represents 10% or more of total revenues. For all periods presented, substantially all of total revenues were generated by clients in the United States. (c) Cash and Cash Equivalents The Company considers all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents. (d) Funds Held For Clients, Corporate Investments and Client Fund Obligations The Company obtains funds from clients in advance of performing payroll and payroll tax filing services on behalf of those clients. Funds held for clients represent assets that are used solely for the purposes of satisfying the obligations to remit funds relating to payroll and payroll tax filing services. The Company has classified Funds held for clients as a current asset since these funds are held solely for the purposes of satisfying the client fund obligations. Funds held for clients is primarily comprised of cash and cash equivalents invested in demand deposit accounts. The Company also invests a portion of its funds held for clients and corporate funds in marketable securities. Marketable securities classified as available-for-sale are recorded at fair value on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Unrealized gains and losses, net of applicable income taxes, are reported as Other comprehensive income (loss) in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income. Interest on marketable securities included in Funds held for clients is reported as Interest income on funds held for clients and interest on Corporate investments is reported as Other income (expense) on the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income, respectively. The Company evaluates whether a decline in an individual security\u2019s fair value as compared to its amortized cost basis resulted from credit loss or other factors. If the Company determines that an individual security\u2019s unrealized loss results from credit impairment, it compares the present value of cash flows expected to be collected from the impaired security with its amortized cost basis. If the security\u2019s amortized cost basis exceeds the present value of expected cash flows, the Company records credit impairment loss through an allowance for credit loss. The Company did not recognize any credit impairment losses during the years ended June 30, 2021, 2022 or 2023. Client fund obligations represent the Company\u2019s contractual obligations to remit funds to satisfy clients\u2019 payroll and tax payment obligations and are recorded in the accompanying balance sheets at the time that the Company obtains funds from clients. The client fund obligations represent liabilities that will be repaid within one year of the balance sheet date. (e) Accounts Receivable, Net Accounts receivable is comprised of trade receivables, accrued interest receivable on funds held for clients and other receivables. Trade receivables are recorded at the invoiced amount and do not bear interest. Amounts collected on accounts receivable are included in Net cash provided by operating activities in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. The Company maintains an allowance for credit losses reflecting expected credit losses in its accounts receivable portfolio. In establishing the required allowance, management considers historical losses adjusted to take into account current market conditions and the Company\u2019s clients\u2019 financial conditions, the amount of receivables in dispute, the current receivables aging and current payment patterns. The Company reviews its allowance for credit losses quarterly. Past due balances over 60 days and over a specified amount are reviewed individually for collectability. All other balances are reviewed on a pooled basis. Account balances are charged off against the allowance after all commercially reasonable means of collection have been exhausted and the potential for recovery is considered remote. The Company does not have any off-balance-sheet credit exposure related to its clients. (f) Deferred Contract Costs The Company defers certain selling and commission costs that meet the capitalization criteria under ASC 340-40. The Company also capitalizes certain costs to fulfill a contract related to its proprietary products if they are identifiable, generate or enhance resources used to satisfy future performance obligations and are expected to be recovered under ASC 340-40. Implementation fees are treated as nonrefundable upfront fees and the related implementation costs are required to be capitalized and amortized over the expected period of benefit, which is the period in which the Company expects to recover the costs and enhance its ability to satisfy future performance obligations. The Company utilizes the portfolio approach to account for both the cost of obtaining a contract and the cost of fulfilling a contract. These capitalized costs are amortized over the expected period of benefit, which has been determined to be over 7 years based on the Company\u2019s average client life and other qualitative factors, including rate of technological changes. The Company does not incur any additional costs to obtain or fulfill contracts upon renewal. The Company recognizes additional selling and commission costs and fulfillment costs when an existing client purchases additional services. These additional costs only relate to the additional services purchased and do not relate to the renewal of previous services. Management evaluates deferred contract costs for impairment if changes in circumstances occur that could impact the recoverability of the costs to obtain or fulfill contracts with the Company\u2019s customers. (g) Capitalized Internal-Use Software The Company capitalizes internal-use software costs when module development begins, it is probable that the project will be completed, and the software will be used as intended. Costs associated with preliminary project stage activities, training, maintenance and all other post implementation stage activities are expensed as incurred. The Company also capitalizes certain costs related to specific upgrades and enhancements when it is probable the expenditures will result in significant additional functionality. The capitalization policy provides for the capitalization of certain payroll costs for employees who are directly associated with developing internal-use software as well as certain external direct costs, such as consulting fees. Capitalized employee costs are limited to the time directly spent on such projects. Capitalized internal-use software costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives, which are generally two (h) Property and Equipment and Long-Lived Assets Property and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation on property and equipment is calculated on the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, generally three Long-lived assets, such as property and equipment, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. If circumstances require a long-lived asset or asset group to be tested for possible impairment, the Company first compares the undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by that asset or asset group to its carrying amount. If the carrying amount of the long-lived asset or asset group is not recoverable on an undiscounted cash flow basis, an impairment is recognized to the extent that the carrying amount exceeds its fair value. Fair value is determined through various valuation techniques including discounted cash flow models, quoted market values and third-party independent appraisals, as considered necessary. (i) Business Combination The Company accounts for business combinations in accordance with ASC 805, Business Combinations using the acquisition method of accounting. It allocates the purchase price consideration associated with its acquisitions to the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their respective acquisition dates, with the excess recorded to goodwill. Estimating the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires the use of significant judgments and estimates, which are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement as additional information becomes available. Adjustments to the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed may be recorded during the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition date, with the corresponding offset to goodwill. The Company engages a valuation specialist to assist in the fair value measurement of assets acquired and liabilities assumed for each acquisition. (j) Intangible Assets, Net of Accumulated Amortization Intangible assets are comprised primarily of acquired client relationships, proprietary technology, trade names and non-solicitation agreements and are reported net of accumulated amortization on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company uses the straight-line method of amortization to amortize client relationships over a five five (k) Goodwill Goodwill is an asset representing the future economic benefits arising from other assets acquired in a business combination that are not individually identified and separately recognized. Goodwill is not amortized, but instead is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level. If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, the Company would record an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit\u2019s fair value, but the loss recognized should not exceed the amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit. The Company performs its annual impairment review of goodwill in its fiscal fourth quarter or when a triggering event occurs between annual impairment tests. No impairment was recorded in fiscal 2021, 2022 or 2023 as a result of the Company\u2019s qualitative assessments over its single reporting segment. (l) Leases The Company determines if an arrangement is a lease at agreement inception. Operating leases are included in Operating lease right-of-use assets, Accrued expenses, and Long-term operating lease liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Right-of-use assets represent the Company\u2019s right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent the Company\u2019s obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Operating lease right-of-use assets and liabilities are recognized at the lease commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. In determining the present value of lease payments, the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at the lease commencement date. The operating lease right-of-use assets also include any lease payments made at or before the commencement date and are reduced by any lease incentives received. The Company\u2019s lease terms may include options to renew or extend a lease. The Company recognizes amounts in Operating lease right-of- use assets and Operating lease liabilities when it is reasonably certain it will exercise such options. Leases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not recorded on the balance sheet. Lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the expected lease term. The Company\u2019s most significant leases are real estate leases of office space. The remaining operating leases are primarily comprised of leases of printers and other equipment. For all leases, the Company has elected the practical expedient permitted under Topic 842 to combine lease and non-lease components. As a result, non-lease components, such as common area or equipment maintenance charges, are accounted for as a single lease element. The Company does not have any material finance leases. Fixed lease expense payments are recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Variable lease payments vary because of changes in facts or circumstances occurring after the commencement date, other than the passage of time, and are often due to changes in an external market rate or the value of an index (e.g., Consumer Price Index). Certain of the Company\u2019s operating lease agreements include variable payments that are passed through by the lessor, such as insurance, taxes, and common area maintenance, payments based on the usage of the asset, and rental payments adjusted periodically for inflation. Variable payments are expensed as incurred and included within variable rent expense. The Company\u2019s lease agreements do not contain material residual value guarantees, restrictions, or covenants. (m) Income Taxes Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. Deferred tax assets may be reduced by a valuation allowance to the extent we determine it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Management judgment is required in determining the period in which the reversal of a valuation allowance should occur. The Company is required to consider all available evidence, both positive and negative, such as historical levels of income and future forecasts of taxable income among other items, in determining whether a full or partial release of its valuation allowance is required. The Company is also required to schedule future taxable income in accordance with accounting standards that address income taxes to assess the appropriateness of a valuation allowance, which further requires the exercise of significant management judgment. The Company\u2019s accounting for deferred tax consequences represents the best estimate of those future events. The Company recognizes the effect of income tax positions only if those positions are more likely than not of being sustained. Recognized income tax positions are measured at the largest amount that is greater than 50% likely of being realized. Changes in recognition or measurement are reflected in the period in which the change in judgment occurs. When applicable, the Company records interest and penalties as an element of income tax expense. Refer to Note 14 for additional information on income taxes. (n) Revenue Recognition The Company applies Accounting Standards Codification Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (\u201cTopic 606\u201d). Topic 606 requires revenue to be recognized when an entity transfers control of goods or services to a customer in an amount that reflects the consideration to which a company also expects to be entitled to for those goods or services. To achieve this core principle, the Company recognizes revenue from contracts with customers based on the following five steps: 1) Identify the contract with a customer; 2) Identify the performance obligations in the contract; 3) Determine the transaction price; 4) Allocate the transaction price to performance obligations in the contract; and 5) Recognize revenue when or as the Company satisfies a performance obligation. The Company derives its revenue from contracts predominantly from recurring and non-recurring service fees. While the majority of its agreements are generally cancellable by the client on 60 days\u2019 notice or less, the Company offers term agreements to its clients, which are generally two years in length. Recurring fees are derived from cloud-based payroll and HCM software solutions as follows: \u2022 Payroll processing and related services, including payroll reporting and tax filing services, are delivered on a weekly, biweekly, semi-monthly, or monthly basis depending upon the payroll frequency of the client and on an annual basis if a client selects W-2 preparation and processing services, \u2022 Time and attendance reporting services, including time clock rentals, are delivered on a monthly basis, and \u2022 HR-related software solutions, including employee management and benefits enrollment and administration, are delivered on a monthly basis. The majority of the Company\u2019s recurring fees are satisfied over time as services are provided. The performance obligations related to payroll services are satisfied upon the processing of the client\u2019s payroll with the fee charged and collected based on a per employee per payroll frequency fee. The performance obligations related to HCM related services are satisfied over time each month with the fee charged and collected based on a per employee per month fee. For subscription-based fees which can include payroll, time and attendance, and other HCM related services, the Company recognizes the applicable recurring fees over time each month with the fee charged and collected based on a per employee per month fee. The Company has certain optional performance obligations that are satisfied at a point in time including the sales of time clocks and W-2 services. Non-recurring service fees consist mainly of nonrefundable implementation fees, which involve setting the client up in, and loading data into, the Company\u2019s cloud-based modules. These implementation activities are considered set-up activities. The Company has determined that the nonrefundable upfront fees provide certain clients with a material right to renew the contract. Implementation fees are deferred and amortized generally over a period up to 24 months. Sales taxes collected from clients and remitted to governmental authorities where applicable are accounted for on a net basis and therefore are excluded from revenues in the Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income. Interest income earned on funds held for clients is recognized in Interest income on funds held for clients when earned as the collection, holding and remittance of these funds are components of providing services to clients. (o) Cost of Revenues Cost of revenues consists primarily of costs to provide HCM and payroll solutions relating to the provision of ongoing client support and implementation activities and also includes amortization of capitalized internal-use software and certain acquired intangibles. The Company generally expenses these costs when incurred except for costs related to the implementation of the Company\u2019s proprietary products. These costs are capitalized and amortized over a period of 7 years. (p) Advertising Advertising costs are expensed as incurred. Advertising costs amounted to $3,189, $8,335 and $15,700 for the years ended June 30, 2021, 2022 and 2023, respectively. (q) Stock-Based Compensation The Company recognizes all employee stock-based compensation as a cost in the financial statements. Equity-classified awards, comprised of restricted stock units and market share units, are measured at the grant date fair value of each award and expense is recognized, net of assumed forfeitures, on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period for each separately vesting portion of each award. For market share units, the Company estimates grant date fair value using a discrete model based on multiple stock price-paths developed through the use of Monte Carlo simulation. For estimated shares purchasable under the 2014 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (\u201cESPP\u201d), the Company estimates grant date fair value using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model and recognizes applicable expense on a straight-line basis over each purchase period. The Company may update the assumed forfeiture rates based on historical experience as appropriate. (r) Commitments and Contingencies Liabilities for loss contingencies arising from claims, assessments, litigation, fines, and penalties and other sources are recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. Legal costs incurred in connection with loss contingencies are expensed as incurred. (s) Segment Information The Company\u2019s chief operating decision maker reviews the financial results of the Company in total when evaluating financial performance and for purposes of allocating resources. The Company has thus determined that it operates in a single reporting segment. For fiscal 2023, the Company\u2019s chief operation decision maker was the Company\u2019s Co-Chief Executive Officers.

        "(3) Revenue The following table disaggregates revenue by Recurring fees and Implementation services and other, which the Company believes depicts the nature, amount and timing of its revenue: Year Ended June 30, 2021 2022 2023 Recurring fees $ 609,658 $ 818,137 $ 1,056,808 Implementation services and other 22,067 29,557 41,228 Total revenues from contracts $ 631,725 $ 847,694 $ 1,098,036 Deferred revenue The timing of revenue recognition for recurring revenue is consistent with the timing of invoicing as they occur simultaneously upon the client payroll-processing period or by month. As such, the Company does not recognize contract assets or liabilities related to recurring revenue. The Company defers and amortizes nonrefundable upfront fees related to implementation services generally over a period up to 24 months based on the type of contract. The following table summarizes the changes in deferred revenue (i.e., contract liability) related to these nonrefundable upfront fees as follows: Year Ended June 30, 2022 2023 Balance at beginning of the year $ 8,734 $ 12,233 Deferral of revenue 25,109 40,991 Revenue recognized (21,610) (30,607) Balance at end of the year $ 12,233 $ 22,617 Deferred revenue related to these nonrefundable upfront fees are recorded within Accrued expenses and Other long-term liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company expects to recognize these deferred revenue balances of $19,108 in fiscal 2024, $3,417 in fiscal 2025, and $92 thereafter. Deferred contract costs The following tables present the deferred contract costs balances and the related amortization expense for these deferred contract costs: Year Ended June 30, 2022 Beginning Capitalized Amortization Ending Costs to obtain a new contract $ 145,718 $ 72,572 $ (35,747) $ 182,543 Costs to fulfill a contract 69,175 53,004 (16,154) 106,025 Total $ 214,893 $ 125,576 $ (51,901) $ 288,568 Year Ended June 30, 2023 Beginning Capitalized Amortization Ending Costs to obtain a new contract $ 182,543 $ 80,999 $ (44,577) $ 218,965 Costs to fulfill a contract 106,025 72,762 (25,421) 153,366 Total $ 288,568 $ 153,761 $ (69,998) $ 372,331 Deferred contract costs are recorded within Deferred contract costs and Long-term deferred contract costs on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Amortization of deferred contract costs is primarily recorded in Cost of revenues and Sales and marketing in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income. The Company did not record any impairment losses associated with its deferred contract costs during the years ended June 30, 2021, 2022 or 2023. Remaining Performance Obligations"

        "(5) Fair Value Measurement Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. A three-level fair value hierarchy prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value. The hierarchy requires entities to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. The three levels of inputs used to measure fair value are as follows: \u2022 Level 1\u2014Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities. \u2022 Level 2\u2014Quoted prices in active markets for similar assets and liabilities, or other inputs that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the financial instrument. \u2022 Level 3\u2014Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets and liabilities. This includes certain pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies and similar techniques that use significant unobservable inputs. The Company measures any cash and cash equivalents, funds held for clients' cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and client fund obligations at fair value on a recurring basis using Level 1 inputs. The Company considers the recorded value of these financial assets and liabilities to approximate the fair value of the respective assets and liabilities at June 30, 2022 and 2023 based upon the short-term nature of these assets and liabilities. Marketable securities, consisting of securities classified as available-for-sale as well as certain cash equivalents, are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis using Level 2 inputs obtained from an independent pricing service. Available-for-sale securities include commercial paper, corporate bonds, asset-backed securities, certificates of deposit, U.S. treasury securities, U.S. government agency securities and other. The independent pricing service utilizes a variety of inputs including benchmark yields, broker/dealer quoted prices, reported trades, issuer spreads as well as other available market data. The Company, on a sample basis, validates the pricing from the independent pricing service against another third-party pricing source for reasonableness. The Company has not adjusted any prices obtained by the independent pricing service, as it believes they are appropriately valued. There were no available-for-sale securities classified in Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy at June 30, 2022 or 2023. The fair value level for the Company\u2019s cash and cash equivalents and available-for-sale securities was as follows: June 30, 2022 Total Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Cash and cash equivalents $ 139,756 $ 139,756 $ \u2014 $ \u2014 Funds held for clients' cash and cash equivalents 3,653,697 3,640,427 13,270 \u2014 Available-for-sale securities: Commercial paper 58,040 \u2014 58,040 \u2014 Corporate bonds 57,853 \u2014 57,853 \u2014 Asset-backed securities 9,704 \u2014 9,704 \u2014 Certificates of deposit 31,836 \u2014 31,836 \u2014 U.S. treasury securities 166,987 \u2014 166,987 \u2014 U.S. government agency securities 7,549 \u2014 7,549 \u2014 Other 2,110 \u2014 2,110 \u2014 Total available-for-sale securities 334,079 \u2014 334,079 \u2014 Total investments $ 4,127,532 $ 3,780,183 $ 347,349 $ \u2014 June 30, 2023 Total Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Cash and cash equivalents $ 288,767 $ 288,767 $ \u2014 $ \u2014 Funds held for clients' cash and cash equivalents 2,132,545 2,132,545 \u2014 \u2014 Available-for-sale securities: Commercial paper 109,877 \u2014 109,877 \u2014 Corporate bonds 110,413 \u2014 110,413 \u2014 Asset-backed securities 29,734 \u2014 29,734 \u2014 Certificates of deposit 68,159 \u2014 68,159 \u2014 U.S. treasury securities 156,000 \u2014 156,000 \u2014 U.S. government agency securities 7,487 \u2014 7,487 \u2014 Other 7,200 \u2014 7,200 \u2014 Total available-for-sale securities 488,870 \u2014 488,870 \u2014 Total investments $ 2,910,182 $ 2,421,312 $ 488,870 $ \u2014 Assets and Liabilities Recorded at Fair Value on a Non-Recurring Basis "

        "(7) Business Combinations The Company accounts for business combinations in accordance with ASC 805, Business Combinations. The Company recorded the acquisitions disclosed below using the acquisition method of accounting and recognized assets and liabilities at their fair values as of the date of acquisitions, with the excess recorded to goodwill. On November 13, 2020, the Company acquired all of the shares outstanding of Samepage Labs Inc. (\u201cSamepage\u201d) through a merger for purchase price consideration of $15,018, which was paid in cash upon closing. Samepage offers digital collaboration tools including task management, file sharing, real-time collaboration and more. This transaction expands the Company\u2019s product functionality in these areas and demonstrates its commitment to building a modern workforce suite of solutions that meet the needs of HR teams and employees. The allocation of the purchase price for Samepage was approximately $11,995 of goodwill, $3,167 of proprietary technology and other immaterial assets and liabilities. On August 31, 2021, the Company entered into an Equity Purchase Agreement (the \u201cPurchase Agreement\u201d) with Blue Marble Payroll, LLC (\u201cBlue Marble\u201d) and its equity holders and acquired all of the issued and outstanding equity interests of Blue Marble for cash consideration of $60,961, subject to customary purchase price adjustments. Blue Marble\u2019s payroll platform enables U.S.-based companies to manage payroll for employees outside the U.S. in line with complex local and country-specific requirements across many countries. This acquisition enables the Company to better serve its clients in managing their international workforces through a unified solution to pay employees, automate processes and stay compliant with regulations in other countries. An entity affiliated with Steven I. Sarowitz, the Chairman of the Board of Directors and the largest shareholder of the Company, was the largest equity holder of Blue Marble. The Board of Directors of the Company appointed the Audit Committee, which is comprised solely of directors who are independent of the management of Blue Marble, the Blue Marble equity holders and the Company, to evaluate, assess and negotiate on its behalf the terms and conditions in the Purchase Agreement. The Audit Committee and the disinterested directors of the Company\u2019s Board of Directors unanimously approved the Purchase Agreement and transactions specified within it. The allocation of the purchase price for Blue Marble was as follows: August 31, 2021 Proprietary technology $ 21,200 Client relationships 3,000 Trade names 1,200 Goodwill 34,776 Other assets acquired 2,659 Liabilities assumed (1,874) Total purchase price $ 60,961 On January 18, 2022, the Company acquired all of the shares outstanding of Cloudsnap, Inc., (\"Cloudsnap\") through a merger for cash consideration of $50,002, which was paid upon closing. Cloudsnap is a provider of a flexible, low-code solution for integrating disparate business applications. This transaction enables the Company to deliver modern integrations and seamless data sharing between critical systems more efficiently and effectively, while helping to unify and automate business processes across clients' HR, finance, benefits, and other systems. The allocation of the purchase price for Cloudsnap was as follows: January 18, 2022 Proprietary technology $ 15,800 Goodwill 33,628 Other assets acquired 3,398 Liabilities assumed (2,824) Total purchase price $ 50,002 The results from these acquisitions have been included in the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements since the closing of the acquisitions and are not material to the Company. Pro forma information was not presented because the effects of the acquisitions are not material to the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements. The goodwill related to these transactions is primarily attributable to the assembled workforce and growth opportunities from the expansion and enhancement of the Company\u2019s product offerings. The goodwill associated with the Blue Marble acquisition is deductible for income tax purposes. The goodwill associated with the Samepage and Cloudsnap acquisitions is not deductible for income tax purposes. Direct costs related to these acquisitions were immaterial and expensed as incurred as Cost of revenues and General and administrative in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income."

        "(12) Debt In July 2019, the Company entered into a revolving credit agreement with PNC Bank, National Association, and other lenders, which is secured by substantially all of the Company\u2019s assets, subject to certain restrictions. In August 2022, the Company entered into a first amendment to the aforementioned credit agreement to increase the borrowing capacity of our revolving credit facility (\"credit facility\") to $550,000, which may be increased up to $825,000, subject to obtaining additional lender commitments and certain approvals and satisfying other requirements. The amended credit agreement extends the maturity date of the credit facility to August 2027 and replaces the interest rate based on London Interbank Offered Rate with an interest rate based on secured overnight financing rate (\"SOFR\"). In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, the Company borrowed $100,000 under the credit facility, which it repaid in the third quarter of fiscal 2021. In January 2022, the Company borrowed $50,000 under the credit facility in connection with its acquisition of Cloudsnap, which it repaid during the third quarter of fiscal 2022. The Company had no borrowings at June 30, 2022 or June 30, 2023 and did not borrow any amounts during fiscal 2023 . The Company incurred interest expense related to any borrowings at average interest rates of 1.04% and 1.01% during the years ended June 30, 2021 and June 30, 2022, respectively . The proceeds of any borrowings are to be used to fund working capital, capital expenditures and general corporate purposes, including permitted acquisitions, permitted investments, permitted distributions and share repurchases. The Company may generally borrow, prepay and reborrow under the credit facility and terminate or reduce the lenders\u2019 commitments at any time prior to revolving credit facility expiration without a premium or a penalty, other than customary \u201cbreakage\u201d costs. Any borrowings under the credit facility will generally bear interest, at the Company\u2019s option, at a rate per annum determined by reference to either the Term SOFR rate plus the SOFR Adjustment or an adjusted base rate, in each case plus an applicable margin ranging from 0.875% to 1.500% and 0.00% to 0.500%, respectively, based on the then-applicable net total leverage ratio. Additionally, the Company is required to pay certain commitment, letter of credit fronting and letter of credit participation fees on available and/or undrawn portions of the credit facility."

        "(13) Leases The Company primarily leases office space under non-cancellable operating leases expiring on various dates from March 2024 through October 2032. The leases provide for increasing annual base rents and oblige the Company to fund its proportionate share of operating expenses and, in certain cases, real estate taxes. The Company also leases various types of office and production related equipment under non-cancellable operating leases expiring on various dates from February 2024 through December 2027. The components of operating lease expense were as follows: Year Ended June 30, 2021 2022 2023 Operating lease cost $ 9,139 $ 7,509 $ 8,868 Short-term lease cost $ 75 345 301 Variable lease cost $ 4,796 4,579 5,358 Total lease costs $ 14,010 $ 12,433 $ 14,527 The classification of the Company\u2019s operating lease right-of-use assets, operating lease liabilities and other supplemental information related to the Company\u2019s operating leases are as follows: June 30, 2022 2023 Operating lease right-of-use assets $ 49,210 $ 44,067 Accrued expenses $ 8,399 $ 7,800 Long-term operating lease liabilities $ 69,119 $ 62,471 Weighted-average remaining lease term (years) 8.9 8.0 Weighted-average discount rate 3.46 % 3.52 % The following table summarizes supplemental cash flow information related to the Company\u2019s operating leases: Year Ended June 30, 2021 2022 2023 Cash paid for amounts included in the measurement of operating lease liabilities $ 11,093 $ 9,955 $ 10,958 Operating lease assets obtained in exchange for new liabilities $ 1,682 $ 10,084 $ 1,264 The undiscounted cash flows for future maturities of the Company\u2019s operating lease liabilities and the reconciliation to the balance of operating lease liabilities reflected on the Company\u2019s balance sheet are as follows as of June 30, 2023: Fiscal 2024 $ 10,050 Fiscal 2025 10,321 Fiscal 2026 9,909 Fiscal 2027 9,470 Fiscal 2028 9,490 Thereafter 32,053 Total undiscounted cash flows 81,293 Less: Present value discount (11,022) Total operating lease liabilities $ 70,271 As of June 30, 2023, the Company had not entered into any leases that had not yet commenced."

        "(14) Income Taxes (a) Income Taxes Income tax expense (benefit) for the years ended June 30, 2021, 2022 and 2023 consists of the following: Year Ended June 30, 2021 2022 2023 Current taxes Federal $ \u2014 $ \u2014 $ 1,702 State and local (75) (16) 2,625 Deferred taxes: Federal (10,476) (4,214) 17,973 State and local (3,164) (2,950) (4,508) Total income tax expense (benefit) $ (13,715) $ (7,180) $ 17,792 (b) Tax Rate Reconciliation Income tax expense (benefit) differed from the amounts computed by applying the U.S. federal income tax rate of 21% for the years ended June 30, 2021, 2022 and 2023 to pretax income as a result of the following: Year Ended June 30, 2021 2022 2023 Income tax expense (benefit) at statutory federal rate 21.0 % 21.0 % 21.0 % Increase (reduction) in income taxes resulting from: Research and development credit and other credits (7.1) (5.3) (3.1) Non-deductible expenses 1.4 1.5 1.0 Change in valuation allowance 2.8 0.4 (2.8) Stock-based compensation expense (35.0) (21.9) (6.1) State and local income taxes, net of federal income tax benefit (6.7) (4.0) 1.3 Other (0.4) (0.3) (0.1) (24.0) % (8.6) % 11.2 % The effective tax rate for the years ended June 30, 2021, 2022 and 2023 was (24.0)%, (8.6)% and 11.2%, respectively, on pre-tax income of $57,104, $83,597 and $158,614, respectively. The increase in the effective tax rate is primarily due to decreased deductions related to stock-based compensation. (c) Components of Deferred Tax Assets and Liabilities The tax effects of temporary differences that give rise to significant portions of the deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities at June 30, 2022 and 2023 are presented below. June 30, 2022 2023 Deferred tax assets: Operating lease liabilities $ 19,979 $ 18,238 Accrued expenses 16,143 19,610 Stock-based compensation 22,857 27,402 Net operating loss carryforwards 45,574 13,010 Federal and state tax credits 30,498 35,016 Research and development costs \u2014 12,523 Other 1,064 1,204 Total deferred tax assets 136,115 127,003 Valuation allowance (5,850) (1,350) Net deferred tax assets 130,265 125,653 Deferred tax liabilities: Deferred contract costs (75,028) (96,598) Operating lease right-of-use assets (12,708) (11,456) Research and development costs (13,661) \u2014 Intangible assets (3,725) (2,626) Depreciation (8,300) (10,947) Total deferred tax liabilities (113,422) (121,627) Net deferred tax asset (liability) $ 16,843 $ 4,026 As of June 30, 2023, the Company maintains a valuation allowance of $1,350 for certain state tax benefits which may not be realized. Such assessment may change in the future as further evidence becomes available. At June 30, 2023, the Company has gross net operating loss carryforwards for federal income tax purposes of approximately $49,087, all of which can be carried forward indefinitely. The Company has gross net operating loss carryforwards for state income tax purposes of approximately $45,349, of which $35,850 expire from 2023 to 2042, while the remaining $9,499 can be carried forward indefinitely. The Company also has gross federal and state research and development tax credits and other state credit carryforwards of approximately $41,085, which expire between 2023 and 2042. As of June 30, 2022 and 2023, the Company\u2019s liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits, which would impact the Company\u2019s effective tax rate if recognized, are presented below. The Company will include applicable penalties and interest when the benefit is recognized: Year Ended June 30, 2022 2023 Unrecognized tax benefits at beginning of the year $ 534 $ 1,015 Additions for current year tax positions 380 570 Additions for tax positions of prior periods 101 \u2014 Subtractions for tax positions of prior periods \u2014 (33) Unrecognized tax benefit at end of year $ 1,015 $ 1,552 three"

        "(16) Benefit Plans (a) Equity Incentive Plans The Company previously maintained a 2008 Equity Incentive Plan (the \u201c2008 Plan\u201d) and currently maintains a 2014 Equity Incentive Plan (the \u201c2014 Plan\u201d) pursuant to which the Company has reserved shares of its common stock for issuance to its employees, directors and non-employee third parties. The 2014 Plan serves as the successor to the 2008 Plan and permits the granting of restricted stock units and other equity incentives at the discretion of the compensation committee of the Company\u2019s board of directors (\u201cthe Committee\u201d). No new awards have been or will be issued under the 2008 Plan since the effective date of the 2014 Plan. The number of shares of common stock reserved for issuance under the 2014 Plan may increase each calendar year, continuing through and including January 1, 2024. The number of shares added each year may be equal to the lesser of (a) four and five tenths percent (4.5%) of the number of shares of common stock of the Company issued and outstanding on the immediately preceding December 31, or (b) an amount determined by the Company\u2019s board of directors. As of June 30, 2023, the Company had 13,699 shares allocated to the plans, of which 1,701 shares were subject to outstanding options or awards. Generally, the Company issues previously unissued shares for the exercise of stock options or vesting of awards; however, shares previously subject to 2014 Plan grants or awards that are forfeited or net settled at exercise or release may be reissued to satisfy future issuances. The following table summarizes the changes in the number of shares available for grant under the Company\u2019s equity incentive plans during the year ended June 30, 2023: Number of Available for grant at July 1 ,2022 12,393 RSUs granted (795) MSUs granted (82) Shares withheld in settlement of taxes and/or exercise price 382 Forfeitures 168 Shares removed (68) Available for grant at June 30, 2023 11,998 Shares removed represents forfeitures of shares and shares withheld in settlement of taxes and/or payment of exercise price related to grants made under the 2008 Plan. As noted above, no new awards will be issued under the 2008 Plan, and there were no awards outstanding under the 2008 Plan as of June 30, 2023. Stock-based compensation expense related to stock options, restricted stock units (\u201cRSUs\u201d), market share units (\u201cMSUs\u201d) and the Employee Stock Purchase Plan (as described below) was included in the following line items in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income: Year Ended June 30, 2021 2022 2023 Cost of revenues $ 7,687 $ 11,622 $ 17,101 Sales and marketing 15,658 21,854 36,930 Research and development 10,192 18,696 36,475 General and administrative 29,515 44,030 56,794 Total stock-based compensation expense $ 63,052 $ 96,202 $ 147,300 In addition, the Company capitalized $2,610, $7,119 and $11,901 of stock-based compensation expense in its capitalized internal-use software costs in the years ended June 30, 2021, 2022 and 2023, respectively. In August 2020, the Committee approved the modification of the performance targets for vesting of the performance-based restricted stock units granted in fiscal 2020. The Company recorded $6,423 and $6,765 in stock-based compensation expense during the years ended June 30, 2021 and 2022, respectively, related to these modified performance-based restricted stock units. In March 2022, Michael Haske announced his intent to resign from his position effective September 1, 2022. In connection with his resignation, the Company\u2019s board of directors approved a Transition and Separation Agreement and a Consulting Services Agreement. Pursuant to these agreements, the Committee approved the modifications of certain of Mr. Haske's outstanding RSUs and MSUs to allow the awards to continue to vest after the end of his service period. As a result, the Company recorded the cumulative effect of the modifications and accelerated the recognition of the remaining expense associated with certain of Mr. Haske's unmodified outstanding awards over his remaining substantive service period. The modifications of these awards did not have a material impact on the Company\u2019s financial statements during the years ended June 30, 2022 or 2023. The following table represents stock option activity during the year ended June 30, 2023: Number of Weighted Weighted Aggregate Balance at July 1, 2022 548 $ 18.34 1.6 $ 85,515 Options exercised (260) $ 12.53 Balance at June 30, 2023 288 $ 23.63 1.2 $ 46,129 Options vested and exercisable at June 30, 2023 288 $ 23.63 1.2 $ 46,129 There were no stock options granted during the years ended June 30, 2021, 2022 or 2023. The total intrinsic value of options exercised during the years ended June 30, 2021, 2022 and 2023 was $84,072, $51,457 and $52,985, respectively. The Company grants RSUs under the 2014 Plan with terms determined at the discretion of the Committee. RSUs generally vest over four years following the grant date and have time-based vesting conditions. The following table represents restricted stock unit activity during the year ended June 30, 2023: Units Weighted RSU balance at July 1, 2022 1,327 $ 168.44 RSUs granted 795 $ 254.59 RSUs vested (724) $ 163.79 RSUs forfeited (156) $ 162.57 RSU balance at June 30, 2023 1,242 $ 225.30 At June 30, 2023, there was $116,517 of total unrecognized compensation cost, net of estimated forfeitures, related to unvested restricted stock units granted. That cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 1.8 years. The Company also grants MSUs under the 2014 Plan with terms determined at the discretion of the Committee. The actual number of MSUs that will be eligible to vest is based on the achievement of a relative total shareholder return (\u201cTSR\u201d) target as compared to the TSR realized by each of the companies comprising the Russell 3000 Index over an approximately three -year period. The MSUs cliff-vest at the end of the TSR measurement period, and up to 200% of the target number of shares subject to each MSU are eligible to be earned. The following table represents market share unit activity during the year ended June 30, 2023: Units Weighted MSU balance at July 1, 2022 101 $ 263.83 MSUs granted 82 $ 387.67 MSUs forfeited (12) $ 278.08 MSU balance at June 30, 2023 171 $ 320.38 The Company estimated the grant date fair value of the MSUs using a Monte Carlo simulation model that included the following assumptions: Year Ended June 30, 2021 2022 2023 Valuation assumptions: Expected dividend yield 0 % 0 % 0 % Expected volatility 52.0 % 47.4 - 47.5% 51.0 - 52.7% Expected term (years) 3.04 2.92 - 3.04 2.75 - 3.04 Risk\u2011free interest rate 0.18 % 0.43 - 0.47% 3.11 - 4.01% At June 30, 2023, there was $25,009 of total unrecognized compensation cost, net of estimated forfeitures, related to unvested MSUs. That cost is expected to be recognized over a period of 2.0 years. (b) Employee Stock Purchase Plan Under the Company\u2019s Employee Stock Purchase Plan (\u201cESPP\u201d), the Company can grant stock purchase rights to all eligible employees during specific offering periods not to exceed twenty-seven months. Each offering period will begin on the trading day closest to May 16 and November 16 of each year. Shares are purchased through employees\u2019 payroll deductions, up to a maximum of 10% of employees\u2019 compensation for each purchase period, at a purchase price equal to 85% of the lesser of the fair market value of the Company\u2019s common stock at the first trading day of the applicable offering period or the purchase date. Participants may purchase up to $25 worth of common stock or 2 shares of common stock in any one year. The ESPP is considered compensatory and results in compensation expense. As of June 30, 2023, a total of 1,773 shares of common stock were reserved for future issuances under the ESPP. The number of shares of common stock reserved for issuance under the ESPP may increase each calendar year, continuing through and including January 1, 2024. The number of shares added each year may be equal to the lesser of (a) 400, (b) seventy-five one hundredths percent (0.75%) of the number of shares of common stock of the Company issued and outstanding on the immediately preceding December 31, or (c) an amount determined by the Company\u2019s board of directors. The Company\u2019s board of directors approved the increase in the number of common shares in reserve for issuance under the ESPP by 400 shares, effective January 1, 2023. The Company issued a total of 120 shares upon the completion of its six-month offering periods ending November 15, 2022 and May 15, 2023. The Company recorded compensation expense attributable to the ESPP of $4,570, $4,676 and $6,393 for the years ended June 30, 2021, 2022 and 2023, respectively, which is included in the summary of stock-based compensation expense above. The grant date fair value of the ESPP offering periods was estimated using the following assumptions: Year Ended June 30, 2021 2022 2023 Valuation assumptions: Expected dividend yield 0 % 0 % 0 % Expected volatility 42.2 - 72.2% 31.0 - 57.5% 41.1 - 57.5% Expected term (years) 0.5 0.5 0.5 Risk\u2011free interest rate 0.04 - 0.15% 0.04 - 1.54% 1.54 - 5.26% (c) 401(k) Plan The Company maintains a 401(k) plan with a matching provision that covers all eligible employees. The Company matches 50% of employees\u2019 contributions up to 8% of their gross pay. Contributions were $2,658, $12,305 and $15,083 for the years ended June 30, 2021, 2022 and 2023, respectively. In response to the uncertainties presented by the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company temporarily suspended 401(k) plan matching contributions during the first three quarters of fiscal 2021. The Company reinstated contributions during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021."

        "(a) Basis of Presentation, Consolidation, and Use of Estimates The accompanying consolidated financial statements of the Company have been prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the \u201cSEC\u201d). The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\u201cGAAP\u201d) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Future events and their effects cannot be predicted with certainty; accordingly, accounting estimates require the exercise of judgment. Accounting estimates used in the preparation of these consolidated financial statements may change as new events occur, as more experience is acquired, as additional information is obtained and as the operating environment changes. The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries. All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation."

        "(d) Funds Held For Clients, Corporate Investments and Client Fund Obligations The Company obtains funds from clients in advance of performing payroll and payroll tax filing services on behalf of those clients. Funds held for clients represent assets that are used solely for the purposes of satisfying the obligations to remit funds relating to payroll and payroll tax filing services. The Company has classified Funds held for clients as a current asset since these funds are held solely for the purposes of satisfying the client fund obligations. Funds held for clients is primarily comprised of cash and cash equivalents invested in demand deposit accounts. The Company also invests a portion of its funds held for clients and corporate funds in marketable securities. Marketable securities classified as available-for-sale are recorded at fair value on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Unrealized gains and losses, net of applicable income taxes, are reported as Other comprehensive income (loss) in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income. Interest on marketable securities included in Funds held for clients is reported as Interest income on funds held for clients and interest on Corporate investments is reported as Other income (expense) on the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income, respectively. The Company evaluates whether a decline in an individual security\u2019s fair value as compared to its amortized cost basis resulted from credit loss or other factors. If the Company determines that an individual security\u2019s unrealized loss results from credit impairment, it compares the present value of cash flows expected to be collected from the impaired security with its amortized cost basis. If the security\u2019s amortized cost basis exceeds the present value of expected cash flows, the Company records credit impairment loss through an allowance for credit loss. The Company did not recognize any credit impairment losses during the years ended June 30, 2021, 2022 or 2023. Client fund obligations represent the Company\u2019s contractual obligations to remit funds to satisfy clients\u2019 payroll and tax payment obligations and are recorded in the accompanying balance sheets at the time that the Company obtains funds from clients. The client fund obligations represent liabilities that will be repaid within one year of the balance sheet date."

In establishing the required allowance, management considers historical losses adjusted to take into account current market conditions and the Company\u2019s clients\u2019 financial conditions, the amount of receivables in dispute, the current receivables aging and current payment patterns. The Company reviews its allowance for credit losses quarterly. Past due balances over 60 days and over a specified amount are reviewed individually for collectability. All other balances are reviewed on a pooled basis. Account balances are charged off against the allowance after all commercially reasonable means of collection have been exhausted and the potential for recovery is considered remote. The Company does not have any off-balance-sheet credit exposure related to its clients."

      "Deferred Contract Costs": [
        "(f) Deferred Contract Costs The Company defers certain selling and commission costs that meet the capitalization criteria under ASC 340-40. The Company also capitalizes certain costs to fulfill a contract related to its proprietary products if they are identifiable, generate or enhance resources used to satisfy future performance obligations and are expected to be recovered under ASC 340-40. Implementation fees are treated as nonrefundable upfront fees and the related implementation costs are required to be capitalized and amortized over the expected period of benefit, which is the period in which the Company expects to recover the costs and enhance its ability to satisfy future performance obligations. The Company utilizes the portfolio approach to account for both the cost of obtaining a contract and the cost of fulfilling a contract. These capitalized costs are amortized over the expected period of benefit, which has been determined to be over 7 years based on the Company\u2019s average client life and other qualitative factors, including rate of technological changes. The Company does not incur any additional costs to obtain or fulfill contracts upon renewal. The Company recognizes additional selling and commission costs and fulfillment costs when an existing client purchases additional services. These additional costs only relate to the additional services purchased and do not relate to the renewal of previous services. Management evaluates deferred contract costs for impairment if changes in circumstances occur that could impact the recoverability of the costs to obtain or fulfill contracts with the Company\u2019s customers."

The Company also capitalizes certain costs related to specific upgrades and enhancements when it is probable the expenditures will result in significant additional functionality. The capitalization policy provides for the capitalization of certain payroll costs for employees who are directly associated with developing internal-use software as well as certain external direct costs, such as consulting fees. Capitalized employee costs are limited to the time directly spent on such projects.

If circumstances require a long-lived asset or asset group to be tested for possible impairment, the Company first compares the undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by that asset or asset group to its carrying amount. If the carrying amount of the long-lived asset or asset group is not recoverable on an undiscounted cash flow basis, an impairment is recognized to the extent that the carrying amount exceeds its fair value. Fair value is determined through various valuation techniques including discounted cash flow models, quoted market values and third-party independent appraisals, as considered necessary."

        "(l) Leases The Company determines if an arrangement is a lease at agreement inception. Operating leases are included in Operating lease right-of-use assets, Accrued expenses, and Long-term operating lease liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Right-of-use assets represent the Company\u2019s right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent the Company\u2019s obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Operating lease right-of-use assets and liabilities are recognized at the lease commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. In determining the present value of lease payments, the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at the lease commencement date. The operating lease right-of-use assets also include any lease payments made at or before the commencement date and are reduced by any lease incentives received. The Company\u2019s lease terms may include options to renew or extend a lease. The Company recognizes amounts in Operating lease right-of- use assets and Operating lease liabilities when it is reasonably certain it will exercise such options. Leases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not recorded on the balance sheet. Lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the expected lease term. The Company\u2019s most significant leases are real estate leases of office space. The remaining operating leases are primarily comprised of leases of printers and other equipment. For all leases, the Company has elected the practical expedient permitted under Topic 842 to combine lease and non-lease components. As a result, non-lease components, such as common area or equipment maintenance charges, are accounted for as a single lease element. The Company does not have any material finance leases. Fixed lease expense payments are recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Variable lease payments vary because of changes in facts or circumstances occurring after the commencement date, other than the passage of time, and are often due to changes in an external market rate or the value of an index (e.g., Consumer Price Index). Certain of the Company\u2019s operating lease agreements include variable payments that are passed through by the lessor, such as insurance, taxes, and common area maintenance, payments based on the usage of the asset, and rental payments adjusted periodically for inflation. Variable payments are expensed as incurred and included within variable rent expense. The Company\u2019s lease agreements do not contain material residual value guarantees, restrictions, or covenants."

      "Income Taxes": [
        "(m) Income Taxes Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. Deferred tax assets may be reduced by a valuation allowance to the extent we determine it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Management judgment is required in determining the period in which the reversal of a valuation allowance should occur. The Company is required to consider all available evidence, both positive and negative, such as historical levels of income and future forecasts of taxable income among other items, in determining whether a full or partial release of its valuation allowance is required. The Company is also required to schedule future taxable income in accordance with accounting standards that address income taxes to assess the appropriateness of a valuation allowance, which further requires the exercise of significant management judgment. The Company\u2019s accounting for deferred tax consequences represents the best estimate of those future events. The Company recognizes the effect of income tax positions only if those positions are more likely than not of being sustained. Recognized income tax positions are measured at the largest amount that is greater than 50% likely of being realized. Changes in recognition or measurement are reflected in the period in which the change in judgment occurs. When applicable, the Company records interest and penalties as an element of income tax expense. Refer to Note 14 for additional information on income taxes."

      "Revenue Recognition": [
        "(n) Revenue Recognition The Company applies Accounting Standards Codification Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (\u201cTopic 606\u201d). Topic 606 requires revenue to be recognized when an entity transfers control of goods or services to a customer in an amount that reflects the consideration to which a company also expects to be entitled to for those goods or services. To achieve this core principle, the Company recognizes revenue from contracts with customers based on the following five steps: 1) Identify the contract with a customer; 2) Identify the performance obligations in the contract; 3) Determine the transaction price; 4) Allocate the transaction price to performance obligations in the contract; and 5) Recognize revenue when or as the Company satisfies a performance obligation. The Company derives its revenue from contracts predominantly from recurring and non-recurring service fees. While the majority of its agreements are generally cancellable by the client on 60 days\u2019 notice or less, the Company offers term agreements to its clients, which are generally two years in length. Recurring fees are derived from cloud-based payroll and HCM software solutions as follows: \u2022 Payroll processing and related services, including payroll reporting and tax filing services, are delivered on a weekly, biweekly, semi-monthly, or monthly basis depending upon the payroll frequency of the client and on an annual basis if a client selects W-2 preparation and processing services, \u2022 Time and attendance reporting services, including time clock rentals, are delivered on a monthly basis, and \u2022 HR-related software solutions, including employee management and benefits enrollment and administration, are delivered on a monthly basis. The majority of the Company\u2019s recurring fees are satisfied over time as services are provided. The performance obligations related to payroll services are satisfied upon the processing of the client\u2019s payroll with the fee charged and collected based on a per employee per payroll frequency fee. The performance obligations related to HCM related services are satisfied over time each month with the fee charged and collected based on a per employee per month fee. For subscription-based fees which can include payroll, time and attendance, and other HCM related services, the Company recognizes the applicable recurring fees over time each month with the fee charged and collected based on a per employee per month fee. The Company has certain optional performance obligations that are satisfied at a point in time including the sales of time clocks and W-2 services. Non-recurring service fees consist mainly of nonrefundable implementation fees, which involve setting the client up in, and loading data into, the Company\u2019s cloud-based modules. These implementation activities are considered set-up activities. The Company has determined that the nonrefundable upfront fees provide certain clients with a material right to renew the contract. Implementation fees are deferred and amortized generally over a period up to 24 months. Sales taxes collected from clients and remitted to governmental authorities where applicable are accounted for on a net basis and therefore are excluded from revenues in the Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income. Interest income earned on funds held for clients is recognized in Interest income on funds held for clients when earned as the collection, holding and remittance of these funds are components of providing services to clients."
