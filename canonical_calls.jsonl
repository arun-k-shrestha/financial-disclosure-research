{"doc_type": "earnings_call", "ticker": "CFLT", "period": "2024_Q3", "date": "2024-10-30", "section": "prepared", "speaker": "Jay Kreps", "text": "Thanks, Shane. Good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to our third quarter earnings call. Subscription revenue grew 27% to $240 million. Confluent Cloud revenue grew 42% to $130 million and non-GAAP operating margin expanded approximately 12 percentage points to 6.3%. And I'm proud to report that total revenue grew 25% to $250 million, surpassing a $1 billion revenue run rate in just 10 years since Confluent was founded. In Q3, we hosted Current 2024, the only industry event fully dedicated to all things data streaming. More than 4,200 people from 1,200 companies participated, making it our biggest and best current yet. Data leaders from Mercedes-Benz R&D North America, Viacom 18 and Accenture joined me on the keynote stage to discuss how Confluent sits at the heart of their companies, allowing them to push the boundaries of what's possible for their customers. And some of the most popular sessions focused on how companies leverage data streaming to power transformative AI use cases like creating customer chatbots, building AI and ML pipelines to detect fraud and delivering hyper-personalized AI customer experiences. We continue to see excitement, interest and use cases around Gen AI growing across our customers and in the ecosystem of AI solutions providers. Last week, we hosted our first Confluent AI Day, a 1-day event designed to help our customers advance ideas into fully built AI applications. In partnership with AWS and MongoDB, we brought together hundreds of attendees from companies like Google, PNC Bank, Whirlpool and Rocket Mortgage, who joined expert discussions, interactive sessions and an exciting AI hackathon. At the event, we launched the Confluent for Start-ups AI Accelerator program. This exciting new program is about empowering early-stage AI companies with the tools and mentorship they need to lead in the world of generative AI. Confluent for Start-ups AI Accelerator program provides start-ups with early access to Confluent's latest AI tools, expert mentorship and product credits from Confluent, MongoDB and Anthropic. We're committed to helping these start-ups create new breakthroughs in real-time AI. We spoke about our relationship with OpenAI during the Q4 2023 earnings call when we discussed how OpenAI's team uses Confluent to deliver real-time data streams. I'm happy to report that OpenAI has expanded their use of our data streaming platform to help scale with the increased usage of their platform. The momentum and growth further validate the strategic role of data streaming in the generative AI landscape. Last quarter, we also celebrated our 10th anniversary as a company. When we started Confluent 10 years ago, data streaming was just emerging as a nascent paradigm. What started with a small group of companies like LinkedIn, Uber and Netflix, disrupting the status quo with real-time data streams has turned into a movement. Today, more than 40% of the Fortune 500 rely on Confluent to set their data in motion. We serve customers broadly across industries, including 10 of the 10 top U.S. banks, 8 of the top 8 global carmakers and 9 of the top 10 U.S. insurance companies. We see significant expansion opportunities across our customer base as we expand from individual use cases to the central nervous system for real-time data. Our growth in capturing this opportunity has gone through 2 distinct waves and is now entering a third. The first of these waves was built directly on the back of the open source traction and was about commercializing that with our software offering, Confluent Platform. That provided the bulk of our business in the first 5 years of Confluent's growth. However, we knew that for the long-term platform we wanted to build and to capture the bulk of the opportunity around streaming, we needed to make streaming far, far easier to consume. This spurred the early investment into what fueled our second wave of growth, Confluent Cloud. Indeed, even when we went public 3 years ago, our cloud business was a small percentage of our revenue and we were in the early stages of taking our cloud business to scale. That being said, we strongly believe that the secular shift to cloud would present a meaningful long-term driver of growth. I'm proud that our team has successfully executed on our cloud vision and Confluent Cloud is now more than 50% of total revenue and continues to outpace our Confluent Platform business. At the same time, cloud is our most frictionless path to monetizing the thousands of organizations using open source Kafka. But with 150,000 organizations using Kafka, we're just getting started. Already, our cloud product comprises over 90% of our customers, demonstrating its broad appeal as we continue to grow into this space of open source usage. These first 2 waves aren't done. We continue to work to serve the broad base of Kafka users through compelling pricing and packaging optimizations for Confluent Cloud and Confluent Platform. Our differentiated cluster types like enterprise and freight enable us to deliver data streaming offerings for all customers and workloads with low TCO and strong ROI. Our recent acquisition of WarpStream adds a third deployment mechanism of BYOC to this portfolio. WarpStream's bring your own cloud model offers a deployment model midway between fully managed and self-managed and opens up opportunities in a set of high-volume, high-tech customers that form a good chunk of our digital native customer base. WarpStream is BYOC done right, built directly on top of object storage. WarpStream's zero disk architecture enables zero ops auto scaling while making it 5 to 10x cheaper than other alternative systems. And unlike traditional BYOE offerings, WarpStream prioritizes security by avoiding break glass access to customer networks and systems. Confluent is now the only company with a data streaming offering for everyone, regardless of use case, cloud environment or deployment type. Kafka is the foundational layer of our data streaming platform and could sustain our business for many years on its own but it only represents a portion of the opportunity ahead of us. We believe our third wave of growth comes from being a complete data streaming platform, a one-stop shop for all real-time data needs. To do this, we are bringing together the key capabilities to stream, connect, process and govern continuously flowing streams of data so organizations can power their next-generation real-time applications. Over the course of the past year, we have been on our most aggressive pursuit of our vision since we started the company and that is starting to yield strong traction. Major new product and pricing innovations like Flink, TableFlow, freight clusters, AI model inference and new connectors will extend our already significant category lead. And we continue to see strong traction across our customer base. Our DSP portfolio continues to grow substantially faster than overall cloud revenue. One of the areas we're most excited about is the opportunity around stream processing at Apache Flink. Let me share 2 examples of how customers are using Flink on Confluent Cloud and Confluent Platform. One of the largest private companies in the U.S., a Midwest grocery chain with over $20 billion in revenue is using Confluent's fully managed Flink offering to accelerate the growth of its e-commerce business, a critical driver of the company's revenue. This retailer had already overhauled its e-commerce solution with Confluent Cloud and wanted to integrate stream processing for all the Kafka topics that had built inside its digital environment, including pricing, promotions and inventory details without any lag in production. So the retailer implemented Confluent Cloud for Apache Flink to combine and enrich streams of data flowing across hundreds of retail stores, its website and mobile app and third-party fulfillment partners like Instacart. This data spans more than 100,000 product SKUs and tens of millions of orders. With our Flink offering, this retailer's real-time inventory and pricing are accurate and customized to each local market so the company can consistently deliver a trustworthy and personalized shopping experience to its customers. Since working with Confluent, it has grown its e-commerce business by 700% and can stay a step ahead of the national grocery chains it competes with every day. A Fortune 50 telecom company in the U.S. and a Confluent Platform customer is using our offering for real-time analytics. Initially, the telecom provider used an alternative stream processing tool which struggled to meet the demands of real-time data processing. This affected how the telecom's enterprise customers could serve consumers and led to higher churn. So the telecom provider deployed Confluent Platform for Apache Flink, shifting processing to the left and rolling out thousands of Flink instances across its infrastructure to run real-time analytics on data earlier in the data pipeline before it moves downstream. Flink processes and analyzes data such as network performance to help its customers deliver consistent personalized experiences to consumers and network visibility for threat detection. By using Confluent Platform's Flink offering and tapping into our team of Flink experts, the telecom provider has saved tens of millions of dollars and significantly reduced churn, boosting its overall margins. In closing, I'm pleased with our strong third quarter results and I'm incredibly excited about the opportunity ahead of us. I'm even more excited for the next 10 years. We're in a prime position to win the $60 billion data streaming category. With that, I'll turn things over to Rohan to walk through the financials."}
{"doc_type": "earnings_call", "ticker": "CFLT", "period": "2024_Q3", "date": "2024-10-30", "section": "prepared", "speaker": "Rohan Sivaram", "text": "Thanks, Jay. Good afternoon, everyone. In Q3, we drove robust top line growth, record gross margin and another positive quarter for both non-GAAP operating margin and free cash flow margin. These results demonstrate our market leadership in data streaming and our commitment to driving efficient growth over the long term. Q3 subscription revenue grew 27% to $239.9 million, exceeding the high end of our guidance and representing 96% of total revenue. Confluent Platform revenue grew 13% to $110.1 million and accounted for 46% of subscription revenue. The strength was driven by healthy demand for Confluent Platform in the financial services industry. We serve 10 of the top 10 U.S. banks with an average ARR of greater than $5 million. The substantial majority of their ARR is attributed to Confluent Platform as these banks are still early in their move to the cloud. Confluent Cloud revenue grew 42% to $129.8 million and accounted for 54% of subscription revenue compared to 48% a year ago. We saw consumption stabilization in our digital native customer cohort during the quarter. While they remain cost conscious, we were pleased with the consumption growth trajectory of our largest cloud customers, many of whom are shifting their focus to implementing new use cases and adopting our DSP products. Q3 cloud revenue also saw a onetime low 7-figure revenue benefit. Adjusted for this benefit, we still handily exceeded consensus expectations. Revenue from DSP continued to grow substantially faster than our overall cloud revenue. While monetization remains in its early days, we are pleased with the adoption of new products by our large cloud customers. 19 of our top 20 cloud customers have adopted at least 1 DSP product and 13 have adopted products across all 3 categories. Additionally, multiproduct customers continue to grow at a faster clip and exhibited a much higher NRR profile. Turning to geographic mix of total revenue. Revenue from the U.S. grew 28% to $152.4 million. Revenue from outside the U.S. grew 21% to $97.8 million. Moving on to rest of the income statement. I'll be referring to non-GAAP results, unless stated otherwise. Subscription gross margin reached a new record of 82.2%, up 210 basis points, while total gross margin also reached a record high of 79%, well above our long-term target. Our gross margin outperformance continued to be driven by strong Confluent Platform margin and the improving unit economics of our Confluent Cloud offering. Turning to profitability and cash flow. Operating margin expanded approximately 12 percentage points to a record high of 6.3%, representing our ninth consecutive quarter of 9 points or more in margin improvement. Free cash flow margin of 3.7% was also a record, expanding 10 percentage points. This marks our third positive quarter for both operating and free cash flow margins and reflects our team's track record of driving margin expansions at scale. Net income per share was $0.10 for Q3 using 353.6 million diluted weighted average shares outstanding. Fully diluted share count under the treasury stock method was approximately 366.8 million. And we ended the third quarter with $1.86 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. During the quarter, we acquired WarpStream to further differentiate our data streaming platform to include the BYOC native form factor. WarpStream is particularly well suited for digital natives and high-scale workloads with relaxed latency requirements such as logging, observability and feeding data lakes. In fiscal year '24, we do not expect WarpStream acquisition to have a material impact on our financials. Over time, we expect WarpStream to be a growth driver as it expands our reach into more workloads across customer segments. Turning now to other business metrics. During the third quarter, we saw a notable increase in overall win rates for new business, both year-over-year and sequentially. Our win rates against smaller start-ups were well above 90% as we compete favorably with our cloud-native complete and ubiquitous platform. This translated to sustained momentum in new logo acquisition and customer expansions. Total customer count growth accelerated to 16% and ended Q3 at approximately 5,680, representing a sequential add of 240 customers, 3x the sequential add of the year ago quarter. New customers include a top 3 U.S. airline company, a Fortune 50 carmaker, one of the largest online meal kit providers, a leading lifestyle retailer, one of the world's largest online furniture companies and many more. The network effects of our data streaming platform continues to take hold in our large customer base. We added 40 customers with $100,000-plus in ARR and 7 customers in $1 million plus in ARR, bringing the total to 1,346 and 184, respectively. Our $100,000-plus ARR customers continue to represent more than 85% of our revenue. Our new $1 million-plus ARR customers include customers from a variety of industries, including health care, travel and retail, technology, financial services and more. Q3 NRR was 117%, while GRR remained above 90%. We saw many of our large digital native customers shifting their focus from cost optimization to new use case implementation and adopting DSP products. This trend has continued into October which we believe will help stabilize our NRR around current levels in Q4. Turning now to guidance. We are increasing our Q4 revenue outlook in addition to raising full year subscription revenue, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP EPS and free cash flow margin. For the fourth quarter of 2024, we expect subscription revenue to be in the range of $245 million to $246 million, representing growth of approximately 21% non-GAAP operating margin to be approximately 2% and non-GAAP net income per diluted share to be $0.05. For full year 2024, we are raising subscription revenue to be in the range of $916.5 million to $917.5 million, representing growth of approximately 26% non-GAAP operating margin to be approximately 2% non-GAAP net income per diluted share to be $0.25 and free cash flow margin to be between 0% to 1%. Looking back at the last 10 years as a company, we have established data streaming as a major category in the tech stack. As the data streaming pioneer, we have continued to extend our market leadership by delivering world-class innovation and business outcomes for our customers. This has enabled our growth and profitability journey at scale. We exceeded $1 billion revenue run rate in just 10 years since inception, including growing Confluent Cloud revenue run rate from less than $50 million to more than $0.5 billion in just 4 years. We serve 5,680 great customers, including more than 40% of the Fortune 500 across a variety of industries. We sustained positive non-GAAP profitability metrics in Q3 with 79% total gross margin well above our long-term target threshold. 6.3% operating margin, now within the range of our midterm target and free cash flow generation at a record margin of 3.7%. And for the first time in Confluent's history, we expect to exit 2024 with positive non-GAAP operating margin and positive free cash flow margin for the full year. These are fantastic milestones for a 10-year-old company. I'd like to thank our employees and partners for your important contributions and our customers and investors for your continued support. Looking ahead, the intersection of cloud, data and AI reinforces our vision of companies becoming software and AI. Harnessing the power of data streaming will be more critical than ever for companies to deliver differentiated products and services, ultimately driving their success in the AI era. The secular tailwind puts us in a stronger position to drive durable growth while generating significant free cash flow over a long runway. We are more excited than ever about capturing our market opportunity ahead. Before turning to Q&A, I would like to announce that we will host Investor Day 2025 in San Francisco on Thursday, March 6. Management will provide an update on driving profitable growth for the next few years. Please save the date. Now, Jay and I will take your questions."}

So Jay, I guess when we look at the past couple of quarters, there's been sort of fits and starts with the digital native group and it looks like those stabilized. Are you at a point where you're starting to see more confidence from your digital native customers in terms of bringing on new use cases, getting past optimization? Or is it still kind of touch and go quarter-by-quarter?"}
{"doc_type": "earnings_call", "ticker": "CFLT", "period": "2024_Q3", "date": "2024-10-30", "section": "qa", "speaker": "Jay Kreps", "text": "Yes. Look, I think each quarter is kind of a mixture of optimization activities and new use cases. I do feel like we felt like in conversation with the largest set of customers, they've kind of done the bulk of what they need to do in terms of larger changes in their environment. So we did see better growth this quarter and feel that puts us on a good trajectory going forward. So yes, I do think we feel pretty confident about that segment when we think about the year end."}

So we've seen a ton of enthusiasm. We've had a bunch of product unlocks as we've released the private networking support across some of the clouds and getting it out to all of them. We've announced the programmatic support so you can write direct on Java and Python programs and that will be going through EA and GA. And so yes, we're starting to ramp of production use cases. And these are some of the early ones. It was nice that we've been able to land not just Confluent Cloud customers but also Confluent Platform Link customers, even though that product is still in limited availability and just going towards GA. And so yes, we're actually seeing a ton of enthusiasm in the customer base and we're really excited about where that takes us in the year ahead."}

Maybe as a follow-up to Sanjit's question, it was great to see the acceleration in cloud and the digitally native stabilized. I guess my question is on the go-to-market. You guys made some changes at the start of the year. It really looks like they're paying off in terms of the kind of the record customers that you guys keep adding. Can you talk a little bit more about that process? And maybe comment on the level of consumption that you're seeing. I know you're trying to land fast and then accelerate those, that consumption trend. But maybe talk about what those customers are looking like when they land."}
{"doc_type": "earnings_call", "ticker": "CFLT", "period": "2024_Q3", "date": "2024-10-30", "section": "qa", "speaker": "Jay Kreps", "text": "Yes. Yes, I'm happy to do that. So one of our goals this year, both in what we were doing with the sales team and sales compensation as well as on the product-led side of the building was to really broaden our reach into the large set of open source Kafka users and land more customers more quickly. And I think that's an ongoing journey. We've made a ton of progress this year. We're really pleased with that. I think we'll continue to work on that in the years ahead. We feel like, look, there's 150,000 organizations using Kafka. We want to go get them all. So yes, the sales focus on these lands has been really important. It's both about numbers but also about targeting. I think we're much more intentional about the customers we wanted to land with. We have this idea of the Confluent 2000 which are the highest propensity or potential accounts and those are the ones that we're targeting on the sales side. On the product-led side, it will fluctuate. We try out different things to try and land more customers but also track them through and making sure that we're getting to high ROI customers, not just landing university students with their projects but really getting into the right companies. And so that total customer count will fluctuate quarter-to-quarter as it has. But we do think we're on a better trajectory in terms of landing more customers at a faster pace. And then, of course, we follow these customers all the way through their adoption. Our goal was get into more customers earlier in the journey. We've definitely done that. We've now been able to see a lot of these companies kind of start that ramp towards production usage and expansion out into other use cases. And so we feel pretty good about the overall trajectory of these organizations. So that's definitely a positive factor heading into next year."}

So I think a lot of momentum on the expansion side, too. I guess, Jay, you mentioned in your prepared remarks, sort of seeing early Gen AI demand. I think you mentioned some of those comments that [indiscernible]. Can you talk about like how that's actually showing up in the customer conversations? Is it just translating to more consumption, maybe a little bit more specifics on how you're kind of identifying that within your base?"}

One is kind of growth in the set of AI providers, right, OpenAI being an example of that. The second is a new set of use cases in the wider enterprise customer base. There, it's really about delivering data to these AI applications. And I think there's kind of 2 things happening. The initial thing is a set of use cases really around that. I think the larger push that this is leading companies towards is more thinking and investment in data infrastructure overall. All of this, I think, takes time. I know when I talked to investors, some people felt this is going to be like an immediate pop in every infrastructure layer. I think we were very upfront that we didn't think that would be the case. When I talk to people now, some people think, oh, these AI things are never going to materialize. I don't think that's the case either. There's something very real happening. There's definitely a set of use cases and applications in customers. Different customers move at different bases. The tech companies are faster. The more conservative enterprises are a bit slower. But there's definitely the rise of a new set of use cases around this. I think that's a very positive thing for us."}

Jay, I wanted to ask you on WarpStream. Talking to your channel, we kind of picked up a large opportunity unlocked by WarpStream, seems like. But I want to ask you in general, is that broadly true?

So the reason we thought that this was appealing was there's a set of large users of open source where the wholesale migration to some fully managed cloud thing is actually a very big jump. And often hard to accomplish in one step, something like this that has a nice cost savings, keeps the team running it kind of in place but it allows you to get kind of halfway there is really beneficial. And we think that this can help us open up some of these large digital native companies that have been on the open source for a while. In some cases, since before, Confluent the company even existed and start to bring them into the fold and we're really excited about that. We've started to see some progress in some of those companies. These are big accounts, so it takes time to land them but we're pretty confident in where that's going to take us in the year ahead."}

Rohan, the NRR seems like downticked a little bit but your cloud kind of accelerated. So I'm trying to reconcile the 2, right?

Listen, when you really look at the results for Q3 and you look at the cloud results, we're actually very pleased with our cloud growth. We grew the business 42% and it's a $0.5 billion run rate business. And when you double-click into the NRR dynamics of it, it is the health of the installed base continues to be very solid. Our GRR for the overall business is greater than 90%. And there are 2 drivers of performance that we called out in the -- especially on the cloud side for Q3. That was when you look at our digital native customer base, we saw stabilization in consumption. And second, for some of our larger cloud customers, we did see that these customers are taking up new use cases and adopting the DSP. Why is that important? That's important because these 2 trends have kind of moved into Q4. And that's why I made the comment around stabilization of NRR around the current levels. To your specific question, listen, I mean, it's very marginal. So not a whole lot to call out there with respect to the move from 118 to 117. But what I'll call out is the couple of drivers that we are entering Q4 with gives us confidence around the stability of NRR around these current levels."}

And I'd just add, when you think about the trajectory the kind of longer-term trajectory, I think we feel really excited about the set of product investments. Like I mentioned this in the prepared remarks that this has probably been the most aggressive period of new product development and release over the last, say, 1.5 years in Confluent, history, more or less as expounded. And I think that's now kind of starting to come to fruition and we're seeing really good signs in how that's being adopted with our customers. A lot of work to do. But when we think about that longer trajectory, I think that's a really solid driver for us of expansion in the customer base. the obvious use case for all of these is growing from just a pure Kafka usage in those customers to a broader platform that not only has more items you can spend on but actually allows you to address a set of use cases that would have been inaccessible otherwise or too difficult."}

Jay, if you think about work stream, could that be actually a bigger opportunity for you guys? Because I remember when those guys started out, they were like, okay, we want to be even more modern Kafka or like be more on serverless, et cetera. Is that kind of in theory, actually like a broader opportunity for you in terms of like using that more than where you are at the moment? And then the one for Rohan, like you called out the little bit of extra help you got this quarter in cloud. Can you kind of help us there a little bit because cloud in theory is like subscription, like how do you get that as a one-off thing? That would be helpful."}
{"doc_type": "earnings_call", "ticker": "CFLT", "period": "2024_Q3", "date": "2024-10-30", "section": "qa", "speaker": "Jay Kreps", "text": "Yes. Yes. Let me try and address that. So -- the way I would say it is this, open source Kafka is a very good kind of open source project. You can take it and download it and use it. What we look for is in each of these deployment models that we try and support, do we have the best possible product in that area? So if we think about our self-managed customers, there's a set of things that they need. We've built an offering with Confluent Platform that's really good at that. When we look at a fully managed cloud offering, we put a ton of investment in Cora which is the back end for that. It's an amazing piece of software. It's extremely sophisticated in making something that runs itself, balances data, expands elastically, all the really hard things in a full cloud service. When we looked at this kind of bring your own cloud opportunity, we thought, well, is there something there? We felt there was a segment of the customers that would be easier to access if we had an offering there. We looked at like, hey, should we take Confluent platform and try and turn it into that? Should we try and take Kora and try and push it into the customer's account in some way. The reality is neither of those would have been very good. Like we could do it, we could check the box but it wouldn't really be a good product. What made us excited about WarpStream is they've actually done that in the right way. They actually had something that was designed from scratch for that deployment model. And that's kind of a deep enough architectural divide that I think you need to do it that way to have a really good product. And so now we feel really good where we have something that is kind of best-in-class across each of these deployment models. And so across customers, across customer use cases, across different parts of the company, we can now really span everything they want to do in the streaming world, kind of without hesitation or reservation. And I think that's a really powerful position to be in. And that's always been our goal with customers is make this something that's a ubiquitous technology across the business."}

Raimo, as it pertains to the onetime revenue benefit, one of our existing customers had plans to basically expand into a new international market which did not end up materializing. As a result, we took some revenue at the end of the quarter as unused credits. As we speak, this customer is a very strategic partner of ours and we are working on multiple use cases with them. So if you take a step back and I know you commented on the Q3 performance, our Q3 performance which was very solid, the underpinnings of that performance was, I'd say, twofold, primary drivers. The first one was the stabilization of the digital native segment. And the second one was some of our larger cloud customers actually adopting DSP and starting to look at net new use cases. So this -- the third benefit which you called out was onetime. But if you adjust it out, we still handily beat our consensus expectations."}

So we don't try and make some kind of big pronouncement about IT spending next year. But yes, we've seen, I would say, stabilization and maybe some acceleration in investment in the digital native segment which is, I think, very positive. We've seen continued expansion across the broader base of cloud customers which is great. So yes, all of that gives us confidence. When we look at the sales capacity that we have in place, we feel very good about that. So this is a quarter where we saw kind of good ramping of new sales reps, lower than target attrition. Overall, that puts us in a good position as we think about what we're entering next year with in terms of both our sales motion and kind of systems as well as just ramped sales reps to go execute."}

As we think about the range of outcomes for next year, I appreciate that you're not giving us guidance just yet. But is there anything you can tell us about perhaps the visibility that you have coming out of this Q3 versus the last couple of years where you did give us an early look. And I mean, it would seem to me that the bias would be towards acceleration, at least from the exit rate that you're guiding here for Q4 for 21% subscription growth. How are you thinking about that? And how should we as we begin to lock down models and project next year, think about that?"}

I'll say which is very consistent with most other software companies out there. But what I'll tell you is the momentum of the business in Q3 was solid. We entered Q4 with a similar momentum which shows up in our guidance. So -- and we also spoke about stabilization in our NRR. So as you kind of look at the second half of the year, in general, we feel good with where we are. So to your question around looking ahead, I'll kind of reiterate a couple of points that Jay made. I mean, in general, you've heard us talk about it. DSP has been a big focus for us this year. With respect to the number of product innovations we've had this year has been, I would say, the highest in the history of the company. And we're seeing good adoption with respect to our DSP products. 2025 is where we're expecting monetization. And when you look at the different DSP products, all 3 of our DSP products, be it Connect, be it governance or be it stream processing, they're in their earlier stages of their S curves. So that's one area of growth driver as we look ahead. The couple of others that Jay briefly touched on was Gen AI, although timing -- exact timing is still a TBD but we feel that in general, streaming as a category will benefit from Gen AI. And then we have a couple of other ones like Table Flow and FedRAMP which are also lower in the list but again, growth drivers. So overall, a decent amount of growth drivers as we look at next year. But again, we'll be providing a more formal guide for 2025 in our Q4 call."}

So there are a couple of puts and takes as you look at. I mean, obviously, when you look at our Q3 performance, we feel very solid and Q4 guide is also solid. I called out 2 drivers in last call. One was, in general, Confluent Platform business tends to be lumpy and purely because about 20% of revenue is recognized upfront and the timing of some of these larger deals can have an impact. So that's something that I called out in our last call. And the second, I would say, a smaller driver is the onetime benefit that we spoke about in Q3 makes it a little bit of a tough compare for our cloud business. So when you isolate the cloud business and you take out that onetime benefit, it very much falls within historical trends and more normalized patterns. So that's probably the second driver. But in general, if I kind of take a step back, we're seeing this momentum with respect to some of our larger digital native customers adopting new use cases and adopting DSP. We just don't want to get ahead of ourselves and we want to be prudent with our outlook as we look ahead."}

And then one quick follow-up maybe for you, Jay. Just talk about the federal business. We've heard kind of through the grapevine and some other companies have talked about it but it seems like federal spending was kind of weaker than expected for a lot of companies in Q3. What did you guys see in the federal vertical? I know that's an important area for you guys. Did you see some of that kind of budgetary pressure that others saw?"}

So we're still kind of waiting to open up the Confluent Cloud side of that, at which point, I think we would see a bigger overall impact, both positive and negative, with the kind of trends you're describing. So yes, I would say it was not particularly noteworthy. We saw reasonable performance but nothing to write home about."}

I was hoping we could go back to AI and specifically use cases you see there for streaming. Where do Agentic solutions which we're getting whole host of announcements around fit within that discussion. It would be great to just get your view on how this AI focus we're getting everywhere impacts competitive positioning for Confluent streaming of the overall DSP landscape."}
{"doc_type": "earnings_call", "ticker": "CFLT", "period": "2024_Q3", "date": "2024-10-30", "section": "qa", "speaker": "Jay Kreps", "text": "Yes, that's great. Yes. So there's 2 primary use cases that we're seeing around AI. One is really gathering all of this context data for the AI. So all the enterprise data that wants to be used in decision-making. The second is really a Flink use case which is actually taking some of the processing that you want to run as a background task and actually operationalizing that, turning it into something that kind of runs continuously. Every time something happens to the business, it reacts or processes that. That's very much the kind of agentic background work that you're talking about. That's earlier in terms of what we've seen. If I look at kind of customer adoption patterns, I would say that, that whole category of use case is a little earlier. I think it's very dependent on the quality of the models. We think that's going to be a big thing over time and we think we're very well positioned to do it. I think ultimately, the goal for AI isn't just to build these chatbots. It's actually to take some of the background work in the company and turn it into something that just happens. And maybe there's some amount of human oversight or maybe there's not but it's something that's just kind of working in the background. If you think about what does that translate to in terms of the infrastructure or computational model, it's very much stream processing. If you think about the kind of more work that humans do, they're sitting there and they're answering e-mails that they're reacting to new customer orders that they're doing whatever it is that kind of background processing. And so I think having something which takes that directly integrates the LLM models with some of the AI model inference work that we announced at current allows you to run that in a way that's parallelizable, that's fault tolerant, that's scalable, that's understood and that integrates this context data that you can gather, I think it's very compelling. So, I would say that -- I would think of this as a couple of directions of growth around AI. One is selling to the AI companies, that's kind of off and running. The next lump is these enterprise use cases around RAG. I think that's going well and will be durable. The last is this kind of agent use cases which is the most nascent but I think actually may be the biggest opportunity. And probably the thing that streaming is the most well suited to where it's kind of the natural model for running that thing. That's -- I would describe that as unproven but we're very excited about it."}

Rohan, just given that '25 shaping up is a fairly significant product cycle for Confluent as you layer on work stream other capabilities.

Or just how are we thinking about the balance between those 2?"}

Michael, when you really look at the last 8 or 10 quarters for us, we've improved our operating margins by more than 40 percentage points. So our philosophy around growth and profitability or efficient growth is really part of the DNA of the company. So every key decision that we make is based on ROI-based thinking. And that will continue not only into '25 but '25 and beyond. So that's not going to change. So as we think about next year, we'll continue to have the same philosophy that is growth and profitability, how can you drive efficient growth and we're not going to basically take our eye off the ball on that front."}

And one point I would make that's specific to that. I think what Rohan said that this is kind of a discipline in terms of looking at efficiency throughout the company. I think it's a very important point. But I think you asked specifically around as we're adding these additional product capabilities, how does that impact things. I think it's important to understand that the investment around the new products, including the training of salespeople, getting people to be able to sell these things, that's all happening now, right? So you kind of -- you put in all the effort, you build a cloud platform that can operate many different product areas. You make the investment in engineers to build out the capabilities. You put in all the tools to be able to track and drive revenue targets around these different things. You train up the sales force, you spend a lot of time on these things that are still nascent businesses, right? And then as those come to scale, that's obviously a very positive thing. But to some extent, we're kind of bearing that cost now. We feel good about that trajectory. And obviously, as these are -- as DSP is a larger contributor to the overall revenue numbers, then those investments are less kind of an added weight and more a natural part of the business. So I don't know if that's clear but that's the way I would think about it. It's not like we're thinking about, oh, we're going to start investing next year to make that true. We have been investing for some time on the R&D side for several years, on the go-to-market side, certainly heavily this year."}

There's 2 parts for it. First of all, do you still see a lot of low-hanging fruit in improving your go-to-market motion? And maybe tied to that, clearly, with DSP becoming a bigger focus for you, how do you think about the changes you need to implement in comp next year to better perhaps fine-tune the effort around this?"}
{"doc_type": "earnings_call", "ticker": "CFLT", "period": "2024_Q3", "date": "2024-10-30", "section": "qa", "speaker": "Jay Kreps", "text": "Yes. Yes. Look, we feel really good about the set of changes we made. So this year was a very aggressive adjustment to orient the cloud business around consumption to drive broader reach to enable us to actually incentivize some of these individual DSP components at a higher rate. That is -- I would call that a radical shift, right? Heading into next year, yes, I don't think we need any kind of radical shifts. We've got some -- we do some tuning each year where we look at can we tweak this thing? Can we tweak that thing? Well, there's plenty of that, that we'll do. But I think it will certainly be a smaller thing. I do think that as some of these DSP components come to maturity and scale, it does open up a new motion around directly landing use cases. If you think about Confluent, maybe the motion has been primarily kind of open source upsell where you take people who are interested in Kafka, there's better Kafka, there's other components around Kafka. I think as we have this full set of capabilities to capture, stream, process, connect, transform and govern real-time data, there's suddenly a whole set of business problems you can go after much more directly. And so I think that opens up another vector for the team to kind of attack and expand within a lot of these customers. I think we'll still land in areas where there's interest around Kafka but I think this kind of gives you another way of going to market. And so I think that's something we'll build over time, not comp related but just makes it -- gives us another path into use cases."}

Rudy, the gross margin profile for the business, obviously, record gross margins when you look at subscription gross margins. So there are obviously 2 components, Confluent Platform, software-type gross margins, fairly consistent over a period of time. So the variable is in the cloud side and we've consistently improved our cloud margins over time. And I mean, I put it in maybe 3 categories, right? One category is, in general, with volume and with more scale, you get efficient. So that's one. The second area is there's been this focus around multi-tenant and as more of our business becomes multi-tenant which includes the DSP side as well, a lot of the DSP products, right, that's going to be a tailwind to gross margins, right? So those are probably 2 drivers. And when you kind of take a step back and look at where we are operating, we're actually operating well above our thresholds that we put out there. So feel good about our gross margin profile and we will obviously keep an eye on it as we look ahead."}

I mean it was -- typically, Mike, when you look at consumption, it is also a business that's driven by momentum you did not see this like 1 particular date or where things shifted. But in general, we did see a couple of things. The first is, just Jay called out earlier in the call, some of our larger customers we feel that every customer kind of looks at optimizations for some of our larger ones, that's actually behind us. That's something that we saw and that had that progressively through the quarter. And the second piece is around the net use cases and some of our larger cloud customers adopting DSP. That's been a huge internal go-to-market focus for us. And again, early days but that's also starting to show up a little by little in the numbers. So that's how I'd call it. And as I said, it's more around momentum. And as we exited Q4, some of these trends actually bled into Q4 as well."}

I guess, for the follow-up there and it sounds like you're partially answering this already but trying to get a sense for that recovery in demand for new use cases or DSP adoption coming from digital natives. Is that explained by maybe customers who have been rolling over or pushing out projects that are coming online now, or is it more a function of that go-to-market that you guys have and the transformation you've instilled and maybe that's starting to make more headway into your existing customers?"}
{"doc_type": "earnings_call", "ticker": "CFLT", "period": "2024_Q3", "date": "2024-10-30", "section": "qa", "speaker": "Jay Kreps", "text": "Yes, it's a combination of both. Customers -- what you would see in any of these digital native customers, even going over a long period of time is kind of a sawtooth up and to the right, right? It's not a pure graph. They tend to make investments and then they tune and they make investments and then they tune. We did see a little bit more tuning in the recent quarter but that -- it's not like that pattern hasn't occurred. It just -- we just sought in more customers all at the same time. Even in that time period, we did see an intention in those customers of making further investments, new projects. So I would say, on the whole, that's in keeping with what we've seen. On the DSP side, there definitely is a comp as well as just intentional focus. Like we are putting a lot of effort into driving these new products. There's very specific sales plays. We're tracking pipeline in a very distinct way. There's targets and goals around that. It's very much a new muscle to build. But the consumption comp makes it possible to do this because in the past, we would have goals that were purely on your committed spend. And really, of course, there's no distinction of what the spend is on. Now we can have multipliers on specific components of revenue that's Flink or Connect or whatever it is and drive those in a disproportionate way. And so I think that does help a bit in terms of making sure that the smaller products that are kind of newer in the journey still get some focus out of the team."}

{"doc_type": "earnings_call", "ticker": "CFLT", "period": "2024_Q3", "date": "2024-10-30", "section": "qa", "speaker": "Jay Kreps", "text": "Yes. I wouldn't say it's a sudden shift or even a 1-quarter thing. I mean I think there's been a broad-based build in financial services going back some years. And I think we just thought it was worth highlighting kind of the point that we've got to, where this is now a very substantial data platform and the largest financial services institutions in the world. And there's really exciting stuff happening. And this is -- it's not just that it's big in terms of volume. I mean this is powering some of the most critical systems that they have. in many of these organizations, they're actually starting to think about how streaming not just enables them to share data internally but how it enables them to connect into many of the other institutions that they share data with on a regular basis. There's kind of that larger economy within that industry. And we think that's a really positive thing. So yes, it's going very well. We called out the kind of ARR and penetration in the largest customers. We expect that to continue. No sign of slowdown. There's not a particular catalyst this quarter. I would say it's more just continued strength. And it makes sense when you think about the nature of those businesses that there's just a huge amount -- they're the largest spenders on IT and a huge amount of kind of real-time event-driven machinery behind the scenes and as well as a few pushes on the regulatory side towards real-time payments, real-time reporting. There's definitely some nudges as well as pressure on having a modern customer experience, all of which kind of nudges it forward."}

The strength of new customer is obviously very impressive. I think I assume that most of these are open source Copco conversions. But just wondering how you're thinking about the follow-on expansion. Is this something that could come in a quarter or 2 because of the consumption model or we think of a land and maybe an expand like 9 to 12 months from now?"}
{"doc_type": "earnings_call", "ticker": "CFLT", "period": "2024_Q3", "date": "2024-10-30", "section": "qa", "speaker": "Rohan Sivaram", "text": "Yes. The way I think about the new customer is, of course, the total customers, I think that's top of funnel. And then how successful we are progressing these customers to $100,000-plus ARR, $1 million plus ARR is something that we internally focus quite a bit as well. So on the total customer numbers that you mentioned, it's a combination of two things, of course, like as part of our consumption transformation, there's been a big focus around landing new customers but not just new customers landing very high-quality logos. And I called out some examples there. right? So that, coupled with our product led, the P&G motion which is driving some of this customer growth on top. But that can obviously vary quarter-over-quarter. So the best way to look at that is over a 12-month period. And when you look at the first 9 months, you're right, I mean, we are very happy of the momentum that we've seen. When you look at $100,000-plus ARR customers and $1 million-dollar plus ARR customers, both those cohorts get see good consistent growth. And as a reminder, $100,000-plus ARR customers account for greater than 85% of our revenue. So overall, the focus is across all 3 but we are pleased with the progress that we are making."}

{"doc_type": "earnings_call", "ticker": "CFLT", "period": "2025_Q2", "date": "2025-07-30", "section": "prepared", "speaker": "Edward Kreps", "text": "Thanks, Shane. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to our second quarter earnings call. Confluent delivered a solid second quarter, highlighted by a 21% growth in subscription revenue, 28% growth in Confluent Cloud revenue and non-GAAP operating margin of 6% -- up approximately 6 percentage points. Additionally, our DSP monetization continues to gain traction with Flink ARR growing approximately 3x over the past 2 quarters. This is a testament to our complete data streaming platform strategy and our strong positioning for the future shaped by agentic, real-time AI. Before getting into the broader business update, I'd like to start by sharing some observations on our cloud business. In Q2, our larger customers continued their optimization efforts and adopted new use cases in a more measured pace. While we are confident that this elevated level of optimization will eventually subside, our outlook for the second half assumes consumption growth notably below what we've seen in the same period of prior years. Rohan will provide further details in his remarks. Encouragingly, we've seen some customers commit to larger multiyear deals following the optimization efforts they undertook last year. This helped accelerate our RPO growth to 31% in the quarter, reflecting the deepening of our customer relationships as they plan for long-term growth. To accelerate use case expansions and support the long-term growth trajectory of our cloud business, we're driving operational enhancements across several areas in the business. This includes two key focus areas Ryan Mac Ban has identified following his first 90 days as Chief Revenue Officer. First, we're improving coverage ratios between AEs, SEs and post sales roles to strengthen execution in the field. This higher-touch integrated approach enhances account ownership and provides tighter customer alignment in driving use cases into production across our enterprise customer base. This has shown early results in the second quarter as we've seen a sequential increase of more than 40% in late-stage pipeline progression. Second, we're accelerating the build-out of our DSP specialist team to drive multiproduct selling. This team focuses on building repeatable high-impact sales plays that include pricing strategy, go-to-market messaging and streamlined migration offerings that combine tooling and professional services. We've also seen early signals of success with this specialization model with several customers accelerating their production go-live of DSP use cases in the quarter. Together, these changes are designed to enable the field to move faster and unlock greater value from our platform selling strategy. In parallel, we're doubling down on three areas where we're already seeing strong traction. The first is replacing CSP streaming offerings with Confluent. We've had success displacing these CSP offerings with win rates well above 90%. This is an area where we feel our product capabilities and TCO story have improved enormously over the last year with differentiated offerings like Freight Clusters, Enterprise Clusters and WarpStream. Already in Q2, we saw more than two dozen displacements against a single CSP offering. We plan to amplify this success by intentionally targeting these offerings and increasing our number of at bats against these competitors. Speaking of WarpStream, we're seeing positive trends there as well. The large majority of our WarpStream business in Q2 is incremental. Even in existing customers, we're seeing customers increase their spend with Confluent through WarpStream while actually lowering their overall cloud infrastructure costs. For example, two customers, a major retail investing platform and a leading prepaid mobile provider both deployed WarpStream for their high-volume logging and telemetry workloads in Q2. These customers increased their spend with Confluent by 30%, while decreasing overall CSP infrastructure costs roughly 50%. It's a great example of how we're helping customers scale efficiently while delivering meaningful cost savings. The second area that we're doubling down on is our partner ecosystem. Partners are instrumental in broadening our footprint and driving customer expansion, especially as we scale into a multiproduct platform company. We continue to see incredible traction in this area. In the past year alone, we've launched a new OEM program and partnered with leading AI vendors to launch a new AI accelerator program. At the same time, we've deepened key partnerships with Jio, SCCC, Databricks, EY and most recently, Infosys. This expanded collaboration with Infosys, a global leader in next-generation digital services and consulting is the first major partnership under this new investment. As a partner in our OEM program, Infosys has seen firsthand the growing demand for data streaming. This is a meaningful step forward in our broader strategy to deepen partnerships with leading system integrators. To underscore the strategic value of our partner ecosystem, well over 20% of our business over the past year has been partner-sourced. Looking ahead, our partner ecosystem will be an important area of continued investment and co-innovation. We believe deepening partner engagement across Confluent Platform and Confluent Cloud will fuel our growth and accelerate our global market penetration. The value of our partner ecosystem can best be understood through our customers' lens. A leading global financial market infrastructure provider that processes trillions of dollars of security transactions daily set out to create a shared Kafka service across its business. The goal was to enable real-time data streaming at scale with the kind of governance needed for a systemically important institution. However, they face challenges with the specialized staffing required and the complexities of operating Kafka as a shared enterprise service. As the organization's long-time transformation partner, EY went beyond pure technical guidance. They helped define a broader vision, positioning Confluent as the strategic foundation for enterprise-wide data streaming. After the deal closed, EY and Confluent partnered to launch a modern streaming center of excellence that helped the company evolve from siloed messaging to a unified, enterprise-wide streaming strategy. With EY's trusted relationships, the focus has shifted to scaling high-impact streaming use cases across the business. Together, EY and Confluent are building a foundation for sustained innovation enabling this market leader to turn real-time data into a true competitive advantage. The third area where we're doubling down is Flink. While Flink is still a small part of our overall business, it has experienced exponential growth with the sequential dollar increase in ARR accelerating for 4 consecutive quarters. Our Flink business is approaching $10 million in ARR and nearly tripled over the first half of the year. This includes strong contributions from both Confluent Cloud and Confluent Platform with a fairly even ARR split between the two. We now have three customers with more than $1 million in Flink ARR and a diverse rapidly expanding base of customers well into their first set of use cases. Capturing the processing of real-time data is one of the most strategic elements of our DSP strategy. This allows us to make real-time use cases much easier to build and to capture the spend on these use cases. The rapid growth of our Flink offering is evidence that this strategy is working. Wix is a great example of the power of our Flink offering. Wix is the global platform behind more than 100 million websites, serving 1 billion users every year. As they expanded into analytics and AI-driven personalization, it became clear that they needed a more scalable real-time data infrastructure. Their batch pipelines and self-managed Kafka setup simply couldn't keep up. To support their next stage of growth, Wix turned to Confluent Cloud and our fully managed Flink offering. Today, they process over 30 billion events per day in real time across multiple regions and clouds. Flink is now central to Wix' data architecture. It filters, enriches and joins data streams in real time, powering hyper-personalized web experiences, live A/B testing and Wix analytics, which gives users and developers immediate insight into site activity. With Flink and Confluent's governance tools, Wix delivers low-latency trustworthy data at global scale. That's helped them increase developer velocity, improve customer experience and cut down on operational overhead. Confluent is now a key part of Wix' long-term data platform strategy. And finally, we've been excited to see AI workloads beginning to move towards production in rapidly growing volumes. In 2024, much of the enterprise use of AI was early experimentation with only a few dozen production use cases. This year, we expect production AI use cases to grow 10x across a few hundred customers. A few of my favorite examples from Q2. A public sector organization in New Zealand is deploying AI agents to automate complex regulatory workflows and cut citizen response time from hours to minutes without operational overhead. An astronomy institute is deploying AI agents to process telescope alerts in real time to filter noise and catch rare fast-fading cosmic events before they're lost. A major Philippine power company is deploying AI agents to interpret real-time alerts, surface critical failures early and prevent million-dollar outages. An international sports network is generating real-time commentary that adapts to the flow of the game and player performance. Let me go a little deeper on one such use case. We've talked about Notion before when they turned to Confluent after it became clear their data infrastructure couldn't scale or support their AI vision. Since then, they've made Confluent a much more strategic part of their business to accelerate the rollout of new AI capabilities. With over 100 million users, Notion needed a scalable real-time data architecture to power AI-driven search, content generation and integrations. Their legacy messaging stack couldn't keep up with the volume of product activity, slowing innovation. By adopting Confluent Cloud, Notion built a fully managed event-driven architecture that supports key use cases across their platform. Using our prebuilt connectors, they stream data into Snowflake and Amazon S3 to enable real-time analytics and AI workloads. Stream processing and schema registry ensures that every change in app is reflected instantly in their vector database, keeping Notion AI accurate and responsive. With Confluent, Notion has tripled platform team productivity, reduced operational overhead and accelerated time to market for AI-powered features. Today, Confluent is the real-time backbone of Notion AI. In closing, while we're continuing to see some near-term consumption headwinds, I remain highly confident in the strength of our business. With our differentiated and complete data streaming platform and strong partner ecosystem, we are well positioned to capture a meaningful share of the $100 billion plus data streaming market. With that, I'll turn it over to Rohan."}
{"doc_type": "earnings_call", "ticker": "CFLT", "period": "2025_Q2", "date": "2025-07-30", "section": "prepared", "speaker": "Rohan Sivaram", "text": "Thanks, Jay. Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining our earnings call. Our second quarter was highlighted by solid top line growth and continued margin expansion. These results underscore the strength and flexibility of our data streaming platform, helping customers unlock the full value of real-time data across cloud, on-premise and BYOC environments. Turning to the Q2 results. Q2 subscription revenue grew 21% to $270.8 million and represented 96% of total revenue. Confluent Platform revenue grew 12% to $120.3 million, reflecting solid performance in financial services and sustained momentum with our OEM partners. Cloud revenue grew 28% to $150.5 million, representing 56% of subscription revenue compared to 52% in the year- ago quarter. As Jay mentioned earlier, consumption growth was impacted by continued optimization with month-over-month trends trailing the same period in prior years. Additionally, an AI-native customer has been making a broad-based move towards self-management of internal data platforms, reducing their Confluent Cloud usage as a result. We continue to support their data streaming needs and have now closed a Confluent Platform deal with them in Q3. This represents a significant reduction in total spending with Confluent starting in Q4 and is expected to dampen our Q4 cloud revenue growth rates by low single digits. Turning to the geographical mix of total revenue. Revenue from the U.S. grew 15% to $164.3 million. Revenue from outside the U.S. grew 29% to $117.9 million. Moving on to rest of the income statement. I'll be referring to non-GAAP results unless stated otherwise. While driving top line growth at scale, we continue to show significant operating leverage in our model. In Q2, subscription gross margin increased 70 basis points to 81.5%, above our long-term target threshold of 80%. Operating margin increased 570 basis points to 6.3%, exceeding our guidance of approximately 5% and reflecting our continued focus on driving efficiencies across the company. Adjusted free cash flow margin increased 270 basis points to 3.9%. Net income per share was $0.09, using 367.3 million diluted weighted average shares outstanding. Fully diluted share count under the treasury stock method was approximately 380 million. We ended the second quarter with $1.94 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. Turning now to customer metrics. On a year-over-year basis, total customer growth was in line with average growth rate of the previous 4 quarters. $20k-plus ARR customer count grew approximately 8% to 2,497 and represented more than 95% of ARR. $100k- plus ARR customers increased 10% to 1,439 and accounted for greater than 90% of ARR. $1 million-plus ARR customers grew approximately 24% to 219. New $1 million-plus ARR customers continued to come from a wide array of industries and include a conversational AI and automation company, a global food service distributor, a Fortune 500 insurance provider, a cloud-based video platform and a quality management software company for life sciences. NRR for the quarter was 114%, reflecting ongoing consumption headwinds in our cloud business while GRR remained close to 90%. Turning now to guidance. Based on current consumption patterns, our outlook for Confluent Cloud assumes month-over-month growth rates for the remainder of the year, will remain notably below what we've seen in the same period of prior years. Given Confluent Platform's pipeline visibility in the back half of the year, we are raising our full year growth expectations for Confluent Platform. This strength partially helps offset some of the consumption headwinds in our cloud business. For the fiscal third quarter of 2025, we expect subscription revenue to be in the range of $281 million to $282 million, representing growth of approximately 17%. Non- GAAP operating margin to be approximately 7% and non-GAAP net income per diluted share to be in the range of $0.09 to $0.10. For fiscal year 2025, we are increasing the low end of our guidance range by $5 million, and we now expect subscription revenue to be in the range of $1.105 billion to $1.11 billion, representing growth of approximately 20%. Non-GAAP operating margin to be approximately 6%. Non-GAAP net income per diluted share to be approximately $0.36 and adjusted free cash flow margin to be approximately 6%. For modeling purpose, we expect cloud as a percentage of subscription revenue for Q3 to be approximately 56% and Q4 to be approximately 55%. Now I'd like to provide an update on the four strategic pillars of our growth: streaming, DSP, AI and our partner ecosystem. First, we remain well positioned to lead the core streaming market across on-prem, BYOC and cloud. Confluent Platform's continued strength has been driven by solid performance in financial services, early traction with partners and our team's consistent execution. WarpStream consumption exhibited fast growth in Q2, benefiting from customers migrating latency relaxed workloads from open- source Kafka to drive cost savings while maintaining full control over their data. While consumption headwinds persist in our cloud business, we believe our two strategic focus areas along with three targeted double-down initiatives will begin delivering meaningful results in a few quarters, helping accelerate our land and expand momentum across customer acquisition, use case expansion and DSP monetization. Second, we are encouraged by the growing traction of our DSP portfolio across both cloud and on-prem environments. As Jay discussed earlier, in just two quarters this year, Flink ARR grew approximately 3x, approaching $10 million with a fairly even split between cloud and on-prem versions of the product. This validates our strategy of building a complete platform for real-time data everywhere and our ability to take advantage of the shift left opportunity for stream processing. Third, Confluent's strategic importance in AI is only getting stronger as the world expands from GenAI to agentic AI. Over the past year, we have seen firsthand AI use cases in production growing from chatbot, semantic search and content creation to code generation and iteration, multi-agent orchestration, agent recommendations and much more. As Jay mentioned, this year, we expect the number of production AI use cases to grow 10x across a few hundred customers. And fourth, we are seeing sustained momentum in our partner ecosystem. In less than a year, we have expanded multiple strategic partnerships, including Jio, SCCC, EY, Databricks and Infosys, while continuing to build strong partnerships with Accenture, Deloitte, TCS and more. Partners have sourced well over 20% of our business, and we are capitalizing on this momentum by continuing to invest in our partners to unlock more revenue streams and to further expand our global reach and impact. In closing, we're pleased with our solid top line growth and margin expansion at scale in the second quarter. While there's still work to do in accelerating new use case expansion, we are encouraged by the traction we are seeing across core streaming, DSP, AI and the partner ecosystem. We believe each of these areas represent a key driver of durable profitable growth as we look ahead. Now Jay and I will take your questions."}

And if that's more macro or company-specific and realizing you noted there was an AI customer that feels like they're changing some of their consumption.

But just trying to get a sense of how that trended sequentially."}
{"doc_type": "earnings_call", "ticker": "CFLT", "period": "2025_Q2", "date": "2025-07-30", "section": "qa", "speaker": "Edward Kreps", "text": "Yes. I would say it's a similar dynamic. I do think this is broadly of the same sort of what we've seen across other companies where customers are happy, they plan to be using more data streaming over time are putting effort into making sure what they bought, they're getting the most value out of. This hit us a little bit later than some of the other consumption companies but it's kind of persisted a few quarters longer. And I would put the AI native customer in sort of a different category where it's not really an optimization thing at all. They're broadly moving into a different way of kind of operating internally. And I think this is across a number of different vendors, including us. So we were happy to be able to support them with Confluent Platform deal, they continue to use our cloud product in more limited use cases, but there is a kind of overall reduction in spend, and it's definitely a headwind for Q4 for cloud. That's a number of kind of positive forces at work here. So if you look at where these customers are going longer term, I think we called out the 31% growth in RPO. And I think that is, in large part, a bunch of customers upping their overall commitment. That tends to be a headwind to short-term consumption, bigger commitment means a little bit higher discount levels, but overall kind of gives an indication of the trajectory of their spend."}

And I guess the other thing that you pointed out is just the growth in production AI workloads across a couple of hundred customers. I guess I'm wondering it feels to us like the relevancy of streaming and processing is elevated in an AI first world. How should we think about some of those production workloads eventually positively impacting subscription growth as we think forward over the next year or so?"}
{"doc_type": "earnings_call", "ticker": "CFLT", "period": "2025_Q2", "date": "2025-07-30", "section": "qa", "speaker": "Edward Kreps", "text": "Yes, yes, I think it's very positive for us. Ultimately, this is turning into, I think, a really important ingredient in the architecture for AI applications. And it makes logical sense like if you want to have some kind of agent that's taking action in the business, it has to have an up-to-date set of context data on what's happening across the business. And so I think we've certainly found ourselves drawn into a set of use cases around that. I think the Notion story is a great one, but there's a number that I called out across different industries and domains. So I think that's a very positive for us. And not the only one. I think the Flink growth is a huge deal. It's $10 million in ARR, which is very small, but it grew 3x over the last 6 months, and that's actually very fast growth for something in the infrastructure space. And in many ways, Flink is the crux of that DSP expansion for us where we feel like going from an important ingredient in the real-time architecture to a full platform. The hard part of that is capturing the application workloads like the real-time processing, we know what that's about. But the question is, can you build a product that actually does it and that customers can use and benefit from. And I think that's gone quite well where it's now producing across both cloud and CP and very nice growth rate. So not something that determines the overall number at this point, but we're very excited by that early progress, and we want to see it continue."}

Jay, a lot of exciting things happening, a lot of good data points coming out of this quarter. But at the same time, you still continue to be surprised by this optimization activity that's occurring with your large customers. You then talked about Ryan Mac Ban 90 days in, and the two key focus areas and operational enhancements that he's making. I was just wondering, is that in relationship to what's happening with large customers? Or is that -- any optimization that you're seeing or is that completely separate? And can you maybe just slow down and explain a little bit why you're confident that these investments that you're going to make in the coverage ratios across AEs, SEs and post-sale support as well as the build-out of the DSP specialist team is really going to make a difference and over what time line."}
{"doc_type": "earnings_call", "ticker": "CFLT", "period": "2025_Q2", "date": "2025-07-30", "section": "qa", "speaker": "Edward Kreps", "text": "Yes, yes, it's a good question. So, yes, I would think of it this way. There's some amount of optimization customers are doing at any given time, right? I think that's been exaggerated in recent quarters, right? And then when you think about what's the balance, the balance of growth is new use case additions minus optimizations. And when we think about what we're in control of, it is these new use case acquisitions. Are we going out and winning the new workloads? Are we making sure we're connecting with those? Are we bringing in the right customers. And so that's obviously where our focus is. The -- I think we've seen very good early results from these changes that Ryan has made on some of these alignment things and the SE ratio, this was one of the changes we made, both to get go-to-market costs in line and through our consumption change. I think just didn't quite work the way we wanted. We were able to change to a better coverage model without negative cost impact. And I think that's paid off in some of the progression of streaming projects that we've seen already. So I called this out just like we measure the early stages of this in terms of kind of late-stage pipeline, how is that trending? And this is consumption pipeline, so it's actual customer workloads heading to production, that's up quite substantially, I think I said greater than 40%, Q1 to Q2. And I think that's a good result that came out of some of the operational improvements there. So that's the early indicator. Now obviously, we don't count our chickens till they're hatched, but those are the things we look at when we think about what the kind of forward momentum is."}

For you, just as we think about your messaging coming out of last quarter, again, surprised coming out of Q2 as well. What can you tell us about the approach to guidance and whether it's in the form of conversion rates or anything else to help us really appreciate what is expected in the back half and how much this may or may not be derisked at this point?"}
{"doc_type": "earnings_call", "ticker": "CFLT", "period": "2025_Q2", "date": "2025-07-30", "section": "qa", "speaker": "Rohan Sivaram", "text": "Yes. Brad, thanks for your question. Historically, as I've said in the prior call as well, we've typically seen a quick consumption rebound after, say, a quarter of optimization. Best example, recent example is Q2 to Q3 of last year. Specifically, what we saw in the quarter was the larger customers optimizing that continued and the adoption of new use cases was more measured. Given the dynamic of Q2 and Q1, what we are doing right now for cloud is we are primarily assuming the cloud outlook for month- over-month growth rates to be notably below what we've seen in the same period of prior years. So that's what we've done for cloud. So despite this dynamic, I want to take a step back and just talk a little bit about the total guidance. We're actually raising our fiscal year '25 subscription revenue guide at the midpoint. And what's supporting this is the strength in our CP business. We have visibility into second half pipeline. And also on the cloud side, as Jay briefly touched on, we are seeing a bunch of green shoots. First of all, the Flink momentum. When you think about Flink, it has approximately tripled in the first 6 months of the year, closing in on $10 million in ARR. The late-stage pipeline projection is we saw a sequential improvement of greater than 40%. And finally, some of our customers committing to larger multiyear deals following periods of optimization. That shows up in our RPO numbers. So when you kind of take all of this together, the back half guidance is for cloud. We're not assuming month-over-month growth rates. It's actually notably below historical averages for same periods in prior years. For platform, we have visibility into our pipeline. And for the cloud green shoots, it's like a portfolio approach. There are upside levers in that, that we will realize. Like Jay said, we're not counting our chickens before they hatch."}

I think it was a critical change for us just to be aligned to what the company is trying to drive and to actually be able to unlock the use cases, be able to have conversation on some of the DSP offerings that might get added on initially, even after your commit. So there are a whole set of motivators, I think it's actually helping with -- there's certainly been adjustments we've made along the way, including the things I called out in the script to try and make sure we're really optimizing for it. So I think that those will help us realize even more results from it."}

And then on Flink, on that, we noticed in our customer conversations that Flink was sort of building the momentum as well. I know that Flink started as a part of Confluent Cloud. I think -- was it second half of last year, middle of last year, you sort of introduced it into Confluent platform. Was that like the unlock? And can you sort of explain to us like when we think about the Flink opportunity, why is it such an even balance between cloud and on-prem?"}
{"doc_type": "earnings_call", "ticker": "CFLT", "period": "2025_Q2", "date": "2025-07-30", "section": "qa", "speaker": "Edward Kreps", "text": "Yes, it's -- both good questions. So yes, it's been a buildup on Flink because we had to -- because of German law announced one of the acquisitions we made. As we're doing it, we had to tell people we're doing something with Flink well before we had the product out. It did get into the market mid last year. Obviously, for us, then we have to ramp it across the different cloud providers, open it up for the kind of private networking types that certain customers have to really get the full unlock. And then we've seen, post that great monetization results. And I think that will increase there's future unlocks coming there. This area of data processing, people know what it is. They know they watch it, they know they need to do it in real time. It's a question of really getting something that's super solid that does everything a modern platform does, but does it continuously and in real time. So I think it's been exciting to kind of get to that point with customers. That ramp has been quite steady. So if you look at cloud, just the growth quarter-over-quarter, but if you were to look into it month- over-month, it is just a very steady ramp. The reason for that is it is a serverless offering. So adopting Flink costs you nothing. It's each incremental query or workload that you're kind of adding, that's building up that consumption. And that is the nature of that business. So kind of building that momentum then becomes a very powerful force even in customers that have adopted, they're continuing to add queries and grow their consumption. The CP Flink is a little different where the tendency is you're kind of pre-deploying, right? So it will come in bigger chunks. Like CP, it will tend to appeal to some of these larger customers that have data centers, has a little bit more of an opportunity to kind of migrate [ in-place ] workloads. So for that reason, it tends to be the smaller number of customers and capturing a bit more in each chunk. So a little bit different between both, but the kind of net-net is we're contributing -- both are contributing. We're serving customers across both and both are actually growing very nicely between the two."}

One of the things that struck me is we've been focused on these big customers. But I guess also when I'm taking a look at some of the customer bands that you report, the kind of $20,000 to $100,000-size customers, which I would think would be kind of your fastest-growing kind of future cohort that will hopefully graduate into those $100,000-plus, $1 million-plus customers over time, actually has been probably the weakest of any of those cohorts this last quarter. How should we think about the kind of incremental number of customers being added to that segment as kind of a future signal for growth and perhaps it's some of the sales initiatives that are going on that are going to be trying to drive a lot more customers into that kind of early phase that turn into the very big customers over time."}

And we think that's a key metric. So that is a point of focus for us. Heading into this year, I do think we made some changes that lost some of the focus there. And some of what I described, we are trying to make sure that we're nailing that. So in particular, I do think these CSP takeouts that I described are an awesome opportunity for that, that's an area where we're seeing a lot of early success. There are a lot of customers out there that have adopted one of the offerings from the cloud providers. And the reality is those offerings have never been great. But increasingly, as our product portfolio has kind of filled out, we have something that's not just a better offering, but it's actually a better deal. And so you kind of have something that's more complete, better performance and kind of better price point with freight and these enterprise clusters, WarpStream. And so early results from that are quite good. And we think that, that particular program and a focus on those lands is a great way of kind of getting out to more breadth."}

I think we shared a bit about what's happening with Flink. I think we've talked a little bit more quantitatively about some of these AI use cases and what we're seeing there. There is a headwind with some of the existing large customers and optimization. I do think that these things are smaller but growing fast. They eventually do predominate as they grow, but to cancel each other out, they have to get to the scale that matters. So in those positive tailwinds, I would include those things I just mentioned. I would include the buildup of RPO and commitments in cloud, which I think is a positive sign in terms of what customers' intentions are over time. As well as that overall progression of pipeline, which I do think is a reflection of kind of the focus on this within our sales organization."}

Jason, you rightly called it out, just for the broader group of folks here. When you think about our cloud business, NRR and GRR are essentially calculated based on the last 3-month consumption on an annualized basis. As a result, just -- it has an outsized impact. The current quarter consumption typically has an outsized impact on both these metrics. So in line with our cloud second half outlook that we shared, we expect to see near-term pressure on both the metrics. Having said that, I'll tell you that all the focus that Ryan is driving on the go-to-market side, be it the double-down initiatives, coupled with the green shoots mentioned earlier, there will be tailwinds. So there are a bunch of puts and takes to the NRR as we look at back half of the year and beyond."}

So it doesn't represent any kind of competitive threat to Confluent or anything like that. In terms of why they've done that, they've built their own custom database. They've built a lot of custom things at this point. They're not even running in the cloud, even though they're owned by Microsoft, so I think they have a bit of an in-house culture, which I think probably is a driver for some of this stuff."}

What accounts they're targeting. I do think we probably had more focus on some of the existing customers and so to really make sure we're landing the right folks is critical. I think the CSP takeout opportunity is a key initiative there where we think there's a good opportunity of things we haven't paid as much attention to that are quite right.

And some of the focused areas that Ryan is driving, that's going to just fine tune that motion even more. So that's one aspect of it. The second aspect of it on the larger customer front, our DSP penetration is a huge opportunity. And that's something that we're very focused on. What I can tell you is like with respect to our larger customers, we are having conversation and a substantial majority of them with respect to having some form of DSP continued usage.

The -- I think it's worth separating out, selling into AI companies. There, there's obviously a set of start-ups that are very predominant in the cloud, and then you probably read some of these larger companies are making investments in on-premise data centers and more self-management and so on. So it's more determined by the operations of the company than the industry or use case. And then when you think about the larger opportunity with AI, do you think it is the enterprise use cases deploying AI in their business. And that is again -- it depends on where that is happening, the -- much of it in the cloud, but there's also large financial services organizations doing big interesting things in their own data centers. And so, yes, we'll see it across both sides."}

So I'm wondering if you could unpack that a little bit more. Like are we seeing customers getting cost efficiencies on the streaming side that are then being applied towards the new capabilities? Or is it something where there are actually less streams being created and they're just applying DSP to those?"}
{"doc_type": "earnings_call", "ticker": "CFLT", "period": "2025_Q2", "date": "2025-07-30", "section": "qa", "speaker": "Edward Kreps", "text": "Yes. I think this is ultimately an efficiency question, right? So we've been through this in the past. I would say it's broadly the same pattern of things, right? There's customers that are making kind of architectural changes to try and condense their workloads and squeeze more out of the infrastructure they're using. That's a natural thing you would do with almost any kind of cloud offering and that's certainly what we're seeing. The DSP growth, I think, is actually separate and super promising. What you need is for that number to get big enough that it outweighs effectively these very large Kafka installations, not exclusively, but certainly a number of them in some of these tech companies that are working very hard to cut cloud costs across the board. And so you kind of have two forces in the business. I will say the optimization, you only optimized so much, right? So it kind of trickles off whereas the DSP growth, I think, is in the early days of a sustained run. So when I talk about just kind of overall a ton of optimism in this space, I think that's one of the reasons why."}

{"doc_type": "earnings_call", "ticker": "CFLT", "period": "2025_Q2", "date": "2025-07-30", "section": "qa", "speaker": "Michael Joseph Cikos", "text": "I know that you had spoken about the win rates versus CSPs and that being an area of doubling down for you. I guess one of the things, it seems like it's a bit of a shift in message here given you guys have historically spoken about soaking up that Kafka opportunity. So to be going after the CSPs more directly, is that potentially a longer sales cycle because now you're going into an organization that has been [ ingrained ] in some capacity with an existing vendor? And can you just kind of walk us through what are the mechanics been thus far that you've been able to evidence as far as those displacements you cited?"}
{"doc_type": "earnings_call", "ticker": "CFLT", "period": "2025_Q2", "date": "2025-07-30", "section": "qa", "speaker": "Edward Kreps", "text": "Yes, yes. It's not -- yes, first of all, it's not exclusive. It's not like we're stepping back from the open-source Kafka in any way. I do think we probably paid less attention to these customers that had picked something from the cloud provider. It's actually not a longer sales cycle. In some sense, it's easier because there's less of a team that does the self-management that has to be displaced and accounted for. You're basically swapping in a better product for less money. And so yes, when we look at just kind of the overall sales stats against that. One of the things that motivated us here was what we felt we've done in the product portfolio, but part of it was just quantitative where we felt like, \"Hey, these deals are winning at a high rate and progressing quickly.\" And we know where it is. So it makes it easy to kind of package it up and teach the sales team exactly what to do in that competition."}
{"doc_type": "earnings_call", "ticker": "CFLT", "period": "2025_Q2", "date": "2025-07-30", "section": "qa", "speaker": "Michael Joseph Cikos", "text": "Understood. And then just a quick follow-up for Rohan. I know, again, we're talking about the changes to the cloud consumption here. If I go back a quarter ago, you guys were already assuming that we would not see a return to what normal behavior would be on that sawtooth pattern. And it sounds like, again, we're adjusting our guide here. So did the consumption trends in Q2 actually deteriorate from where we were just in Q1. Can you provide some more granularity on that front?"}
{"doc_type": "earnings_call", "ticker": "CFLT", "period": "2025_Q2", "date": "2025-07-30", "section": "qa", "speaker": "Rohan Sivaram", "text": "Yes, Mike. From an overall consumption Q1 to Q2, I will put it in the category that the two dynamics we called out were fairly consistent that optimization of larger customers and slower use case adoption. So those two continued. If you look at month-over- month growth rates, they were flattish to slightly down from Q1 to Q2, and that's obviously driving us as we think about the second half to make sure that our assumptions around month-over-month growth rates are notably below what we've seen for the same period of prior years. So that's the dynamic on the cloud. However, I just want to remind around the green shoots that we called out in the call in different parts of our prepared remarks. First, I mean, Jay spoke about Flink, and the momentum in Flink, and we 3x this year, we are closing in on the $10 million run rate. Second, we spoke about WarpStream. That business also showed really good growth in Q2 and the momentum is great. We spoke about the late-stage pipeline progression, and we also spoke about larger customers starting to commit more. So all of these are reissued. So at balance, obviously, the consumption is baked into it into our guidance for the back half but some of the green shoots are something that we're excited to make sure we execute on and go and beat those numbers that we have."}

{"doc_type": "earnings_call", "ticker": "CFLT", "period": "2025_Q2", "date": "2025-07-30", "section": "qa", "speaker": "Rohan Sivaram", "text": "No. What we said was, Raimo, like the larger customers, broad-based like for some of our larger customers, they are just optimizing and a slower use case adoption. If you look at guidance and what we spoke about the primary -- the driver for guidance is our assumption for month-over-month growth rate. So that's the primary driver. The dynamic that we saw in the first half of the year and in Q2, which is just the larger customers, optimizing for cost and slower use case adoption. That's the driver that we spoke about. With respect to the AI native customer, that's just us providing some color commentary as we look at the back half of the year and how we think about some of the puts and takes for the cloud business."}

Jay, if you think about the optimization and what's going on there, is that people kind of doing more workloads in open-source Kafka? Or like -- because like if you think about the overall volume seem to be going higher, so how do you optimize there? Can you just remind us there."}
{"doc_type": "earnings_call", "ticker": "CFLT", "period": "2025_Q2", "date": "2025-07-30", "section": "qa", "speaker": "Edward Kreps", "text": "So yes, it's not -- we would characterize movements to open source. Yes, that's effectively churn, right? It's not optimization. Customers are moving off your product. No, what do we mean by optimization. You can try and take a lot of clusters that you have used across the company, combine them into bigger clusters and try and get some efficiency there. You can try and compress the data, you can try and optimize some of the usage patterns, so it's more resource efficient. You can also do something more contractual where you kind of really model out your growth and commit to something bigger and return for a larger discount. Like all of those are the types of activities for customers that are looking to save. It was the case entering this year. Last year had, had a very heavy focus on consumption. We were probably riding a little bit lower in terms of the forward commitments of customers to their future growth. So one of the things that we have done over this year is kind of take up that commit coverage to more of the forward growth. That's basically a good thing, like you see it in the RPO growth, but it does mean somewhat higher discount, that's kind of the normal discount schedule as you commit to more, you get a slightly better deal and so that would contribute to that as well, which is more of a contractual rather than technical optimization."}

And then a lot of positive call-outs on the DSP products, in particular, Flink and some others.

I would look at that streaming growth rate as kind of a combination of additional use cases, growth and then optimization. And it is the case that certainly for the last few quarters, we've had more of that type of optimization, especially for some of the larger accounts. You obviously don't see that on the DSP side where customers are building up new workloads. There's not a big existing consumption base to go optimize."}

{"doc_type": "earnings_call", "ticker": "CFLT", "period": "2025_Q3", "date": "2025-10-27", "section": "prepared", "speaker": "Edward Kreps", "text": "Thanks, Shane. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to our third quarter earnings call. We're joining from New Orleans, where in 2 days, we'll host Current, the data streaming event where real-time data and AI come together. Turning to the quarterly results. We delivered a strong Q3, exceeding the high end of all guided metrics. Q3 subscription revenue grew 19% to $286 million. Confluent Cloud revenue grew 24% to $161 million, and non-GAAP operating margin expanded 3 percentage points to approximately 10%. This performance underscores strong consumption growth in our cloud business, the deepening commitment of our customers and our disciplined focus on driving efficient, sustainable growth. Last quarter, we outlined 2 areas of focus in our go-to-market and several areas where we were drilling down on early success, all aimed at accelerating use case expansions and supporting the long-term growth trajectory of our cloud business. I'll give a brief update on each of these. The first area of focus was tightening field alignment to drive more use cases into production. As we shared last quarter, we saw strong momentum in late-stage pipeline progression, a metric that tracks the dollar value of new use cases moving into production. That momentum continued in Q3 with more than 40% sequential growth and progressing late-stage pipeline and an accelerating pace of new use cases. This positions us for durable consumption growth and was a key driver of our cloud performance this quarter. In parallel, we continue to build momentum in expanding our large customer base, delivering the largest sequential net add in $100,000-plus ARR customer count in the past 2 years, along with continued acceleration in million dollar plus ARR customer growth. Together, these results underscore the depth of opportunity within new workloads and the continued strength of expansion among our large customers who are increasingly standardizing on our data streaming platform and relying on Confluent to meet their business needs. Our second focus area is centered on accelerating the build-out of our DSP specialist team to drive multiproduct selling. We previously highlighted Flink momentum in the first half of the year, and we're pleased to report another strong quarter with Q3 Flink ARR for Confluent Cloud growing more than 70% sequentially. Flink usage has continued to expand across our customer base. More than 1,000 customers used Flink during the quarter. Stream processing is key as it enables companies to act on data the moment it's created, turning information into real-time decisions and results. A great example of the power of our Flink offering is Siemens Healthineers, a global leader in medical technology with operations in more than 70 countries. The company develops imaging systems, lab diagnostics and connected medical devices used by hospitals and clinics around the world. Behind these life-saving technologies is a constant stream of data that determines equipment reliability, accuracy and ultimately, patient outcomes. But Siemens Healthineers was hindered by disconnected systems that isolated critical data in silos, lengthy file transfers, manual handling and periodic batch processing often delayed insights by weeks. These delays prevented timely action to improve equipment performance and product quality. So they turn to Confluent Cloud with fully managed Flink. With Confluent, Siemens Healthineers built a unified real-time data backbone that streams and processes millions of events from imaging, lab and devices daily. Flink continuously filters, joins and enriches these streams to deliver timely, trustworthy operational insights that help improve device reliability, manufacturing, quality and consistency of diagnostic data across its installed base. This foundation now gives Siemens Healthineers real-time visibility and the agility to move faster as it advances digital and AI initiatives that enhance care delivery and improve patient outcomes worldwide. Next, our partner ecosystem continues to deliver strong results. As of Q3, partners sourced well over 25% of our new business over the last 12 months. This is a clear sign of the consistency and scale we're building through our established partner relationships, which are instrumental in broadening our footprint and driving customer expansion. Confluent was named a MongoDB Partner of the Year and served as an AWS launch partner for the new AI agents and tools category in the AWS marketplace, further strengthening our position at the center of real-time data and AI. Lastly, we remain as competitive as ever replacing CSP streaming offerings. We have maintained win rates well above 90%, with average deal size, more than doubling over the past 2 quarters, all while continuing to increase our add bats. This is made possible with multi-tenant Freight Clusters, Enterprise Clusters and WarpStream, which together have delivered a 4x increase in consumption over the past 3 quarters. Because of their multi-tenant architecture, we believe adoption of these new clusters is a tailwind to subscription gross margin over time. These differentiated offerings provide superior performance and lower TCO to our customers which also helps us soak up more of the world's Kafka workloads. This includes one of the world's largest fintech companies who signed a 7-figure deal in Q3 to move their large-scale logging and telemetry workloads from open source Kafka to Confluent. Another great example of this is EVO Banco, a digital native bank in Spain serving hundreds of thousands of customers through its mobile-first platform. As transaction volume grew, its open-source Kafka clusters became increasingly difficult to scale and secure with rising operational costs and downtime during peak loads. To address this, EVO Banco migrated to Confluent Cloud as its central data backbone. The platform now streams and processes hundreds of thousands of financial events per day across payments, fraud detection and customer channels and with stream processing and fully managed connectors, EVO Banco integrated core banking systems and analytics tools in real time without managing infrastructure. Since moving to Confluent, the bank has improved reliability, lowered costs and accelerated delivery of new banking features. Q3 also marked the 1-year anniversary of our WarpStream acquisition. Over the past year, WarpStream has seen 8x growth in consumption, and we've closed multiple 6-figure deals with marquee customers across different industries, including a Fortune 5 customer. We're encouraged by WarpStream's strong first year performance and remain incredibly excited about the significant opportunity ahead. Next, I want to spend a few minutes on a key aspect of Confluent's opportunity in the AI space, providing context data for AI agents and applications. We're seeing a clear pattern across the industry. Many companies have shown they can successfully prototype AI, but fewer can get those systems into production. AI models are clearly capable, but a recent MIT study found that though enterprises are investing tens of billions of dollars in generative AI. Most of these initiatives haven't delivered the desired results. The challenge isn't building a prototype. It's being able to build reliable business systems powered by AI that makes trustworthy decisions and takes appropriate actions. There are 2 factors that fundamentally drive the quality in AI systems, the models capabilities and the data it has access to. Both of these are significant challenges, but they fall on different people to solve. Improving the quality of large-scale AI models is a challenge largely driven by a small number of LLM producing research labs. Enterprises can easily harness the results of this work by simply pointing their apps at a new model. But getting data into shape to act as context for AI is a problem every enterprise must solve with their own data. This is where Confluent can help. One of the reasons AI demos are often so successful is because they can be powered by a onetime manually curated data set. But to take an agent to production, it must have an up-to-date comprehensive view of all the inputs needed to do its work. This isn't just a matter of trying to hook the model into every source system directly. The source data is generally too messy and application specific to lead to good results. And AI Ops can't be splunking around in production databases, reading through everything and potentially leaking the wrong data to the wrong user, that would be wildly expensive, create unsustainable production workloads and be fundamentally insecure. Rather, the problem is about curating the right data for a given problem and creating a data set an agent can be tested with and evaluated against. Maintaining that live context is what determines how well an AI system performs. That's where accuracy, relevance and trust are won or lost. What businesses need is a system that can keep data in motion so it can be processed, reprocessed and served continuously as it changes. Our data streaming platform was built for exactly this problem. It works to connect data from every system application and cloud and support just these kinds of complex pipelines. With Kafka, Flink and Tableflow, teams can process in real time, combining history and live events with one unified engine. With logic changes, you can go back and reprocess data to create the new data set. Tableflow and Flink work to combine the best aspects of real-time capabilities with the long-term historical store of data in the lake. As this goes out to production, the stream of feedback data can also be captured to measure the effectiveness of each change. And in 2 days, we will host Current and unveil new capabilities that are designed to make this even easier for customers and strengthen how our platform delivers real-time government context. Confluent data streaming platform is becoming the context layer for enterprise AI as businesses move from AI experimentation to production, from static data to living context, and from analysis to intelligent action. One customer that really illustrates this is a multibillion-dollar health and fitness chain with nearly 200 clubs in a rapidly growing digital platform. As the company expanded into AI-powered wellness, its data from wearables, class bookings and mobile apps was siloed and processed in slow batches. This made it impossible to provide real-time personalized guidance through its Gen AI companion. With Confluent Cloud as a streaming backbone, this customer now continuously ingests and enriches this data in motion. Wearable metrics, work out history, purchase activity and engagement events are streamed and combined with contextual data, like recovery status or performance trends before being routed into AI systems to fuel personalized recommendations. Confluent enables them to deliver AI insights in seconds instead of ours, scaling to millions of real-time interactions while enabling security and compliance. Fully managed infrastructure frees engineers to focus on innovation, helping the company turn decades of wellness expertise into intelligent, context-to-ware experiences that deepen member engagement and fuel digital growth. As AI evolves from innovation to utilization, context will define who wins, and we are committed to making Confluent the company enabling the shift by turning data and to continuously refresh trustworthy context for AI systems everywhere. In closing, we're encouraged by the strong out consumption growth and the traction we're seeing for our complete data streaming platform, particularly with Flink. As AI becomes operational across every industry and geography we believe that the demand for real-time context powered by data streaming will only grow. It's an exciting time for Confluent and we're just getting started. With that, I'll turn it over to Rohan."}
{"doc_type": "earnings_call", "ticker": "CFLT", "period": "2025_Q3", "date": "2025-10-27", "section": "prepared", "speaker": "Rohan Sivaram", "text": "Thanks, Jay. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining our earnings call. Our strong third quarter performance highlights the momentum of our data streaming platform and our diversified growth strategy. We delivered strong top line growth, stabilized our net retention rate, increased the adoption of new products and drove continued margin expansion. These results demonstrate our ability to drive durable, profitable growth at scale over the long term. Turning to the results. Q3 subscription revenue grew 19% to $286.3 million and represented 96% of total revenue. Confluent platform revenue grew 14% to $125.4 million, driven by healthy demand in financial services. Cloud revenue grew 24% to $161 million, representing 56% of subscription revenue compared to 54% in the year ago quarter. We are pleased with our cloud performance this quarter, which was driven by stronger consumption across core streaming and DSP, including acceleration of new use cases moving into production. Turning to the geographical mix of total revenue. Revenue from the U.S. grew 13% to $172.1 million. Revenue from outside the U.S. grew 29% to $126.4 million. Moving on to rest of the income statement. I'll be referring to non-GAAP results unless otherwise stated. While driving top line grow at scale, we continue to show significant operating leverage in our model. In Q3, subscription gross margin was 81.8%, above our long-term target threshold of 80%. Operating margin increased 340 basis points to a record of 9.7%, exceeding our guidance by 270 basis points. This was driven by revenue outperformance and improved sales and marketing leverage from continuing to streamline coverage to drive growth. Adjusted free cash flow margin increased 450 basis points to 8.2%. Net income per share was $0.13, using $370.6 million diluted weighted average shares outstanding. Fully diluted share count under treasury stock method was approximately 382.4 million. We ended the third quarter with $1.99 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, reflecting the strength of our balance sheet. Turning now to customer metrics, $20,000 plus ARR customer count increased to 2,533, up 36 customers sequentially. $100,000-plus ARR customer count was 1,487, up 48 customers quarter-over-quarter, representing the largest sequential increase in 2 years. New $100,000-plus ARR customers include many leading AI companies such as Forbes 50 AI analytics provider, an AI-powered SIEM cyber security vendor, a next-gen AI automation platform company. Our $100,000-plus ARR customers continue to account for more than 90% of our ARR, $1 million-plus ARR customer count increased to 234, representing growth acceleration of 27%, driven by new use case expansion across cloud and platform. Additionally, more than 10 of the 15 net new $1 million-plus ARR customers increased their spend on DSP products over the previous quarter. NRR for the quarter stabilized at 114%, while GRR remained close to 90%, driven by stronger consumption growth in our cloud business. Turning to our outlook. For the fiscal fourth quarter of 2025, we expect subscription revenue to be in the range of $295.5 million to $296.5 million, representing growth of approximately 18%. Non-GAAP operating margin to be approximately 7% and non-GAAP net income per diluted share to be in the range of $0.09 to $0.10. For fiscal year 2025, we expect subscription revenue to be in the range of $1.1135 billion to $1.1145 billion, representing growth of approximately 21%. Non-GAAP operating margin to be approximately 7%, non-GAAP net income per diluted share to be in the range of $0.39 to $0.40 and adjusted free cash flow margin to be approximately 6%. For modeling purposes, we expect Q4 cloud revenue to be approximately $165 million, representing growth of approximately 20% and accounting for approximately 56% of subscription revenue based on the midpoint of our guide. Turning to the key drivers of our business. We saw strong demand in our core streaming business and good momentum across DSP, AI and our partner ecosystem. First, our continued focus on field alignment is delivering strong results. In Q3, we accelerated the pace of moving new use cases into production and sustained strong momentum in building our late-stage pipeline, which once again grew more than 40% sequentially. We're also seeing customers commit to larger and longer-term deals, reflected in RPO growth of 43%, another quarter of acceleration. Together, these trends give us greater visibility into near-term consumption revenue and increase longer-term visibility with improved RPO to revenue coverage. Second, we saw good DSP momentum across cloud and on-prem in Q3. Building on the momentum from the first half of the year, we delivered another quarter of strong performance for Flink with particular strength in cloud. Q3 Flink ARR for Confluent Cloud grew more than 70% sequentially, and we now have more than 1,000 link customers, including more than a dozen customers with greater than $100,000 in Flink ARR and 4 customers with greater than $1 million in Flink ARR. This comprehensive breadth and depth represents the foundation for scaling into a very significant Flink market opportunity ahead. Here are 2 customer examples to illustrate how Flink begins to drive ARR expansion in our customer base. These customers are spending currently north of $100,000-plus and $1 million-plus Flink ARR, respectively. Notably, in the last year alone, adoption of Flink has supported both customers to more than 6x total spend. Third, we are strongly positioned to deliver contextualized, well-governed and AI-ready data to companies. We now have more than 100 AI native customers, including 21 with $100,000-plus in ARR demonstrating Confluent's highly strategic role in the age of AI. Fourth, we are pleased with seeing continued traction in our partner ecosystem. On a trailing 12-month basis, Q3 partners sourced deals increased to more than 25% of our new business, up from more than 20% last quarter. As we grow beyond the $1 billion-plus revenue scale, we expect partners to play an even bigger role in driving growth and leverage in our business in the years ahead. Lastly, we've continued to demonstrate the effectiveness of our disciplined ROI-driven capital allocation strategy, especially in M&A. Q3 marked the 1-year anniversary of our WarpStream acquisition. And in just 1 year, WarpStream's consumption has grown nearly eightfold. Following the Immerock acquisition, we shipped our Flink product in spring of last year. And since then, we've scaled Flink into a low 8-figure ARR business. The strong financial performance underscores the successful path both products around and reinforces the strength of our overall capital allocation strategy. In closing, we delivered strong third quarter results demonstrating durable top line growth and margin expansion at scale. We are encouraged by the strong consumption growth in our cloud business and remain focused on continuing to execute on our key growth drivers across core streaming, DSP, AI and the partner ecosystem. Looking forward, we believe we are well positioned to take advantage of the large market opportunity ahead. Now Jay and I will take your questions."}

And good to see the good results, especially the accelerated bookings, really impressive. Jay, I want to follow back on some of the go-to-market changes that you made last quarter. The field alignment, changes in coverage ratios. And it's great to see the momentum in late-stage pipeline continue. What are the learnings now that we're another quarter into these changes? And what conversion trends can you share on all this new pipe? And how should we think about the capacity to effectively work that much incremental pipeline?"}
{"doc_type": "earnings_call", "ticker": "CFLT", "period": "2025_Q3", "date": "2025-10-27", "section": "qa", "speaker": "Edward Kreps", "text": "Yes, those are great questions. So yes, we put a number of things in motion heading into this year. And particularly over the last few quarters, I called out some of those, the specialization model for DSP. That's really important just to be able to take these new products to scale, and it's working really well. A number of aspects of just kind of field execution around consumption. I think that's one of the biggest drivers of that kind of progression in consumption pipeline. And on that pipeline, I think we have very high confidence in it. These are ultimately customer workloads that they have people building that are reaching production that then go drive consumption in the quarters ahead. And so it's a little bit more than just an entry in sales force. And that's why we feel that it's a very promising stat and why we track it very religiously quarter-to-quarter. So I think these are really solid improvements. I've been very impressed by the execution in the go-to-market team over the last few quarters to get this in place and do it quickly. And I think that gives us a lot more ability to help drive these consumption workloads ourselves, right, really land in the right use cases, make sure that they're using our complete product, the full DSP in the best way possible and make sure that, that gets out to production without snags and reaches its full potential. So yes, I think very promising in what we're seeing."}

RPO and CRPO, both accelerating very nicely. Why or why shouldn't we look to that as a reliable leading indicator for Confluent specifically?"}
{"doc_type": "earnings_call", "ticker": "CFLT", "period": "2025_Q3", "date": "2025-10-27", "section": "qa", "speaker": "Rohan Sivaram", "text": "Yes. Great question, Brad. Thank you. You're right. RPO, in general, what I've shared before is when you think about our business for Confluent platform, absolutely. RPO is the single most important leading indicator with respect to the forward-looking organic growth of the business. For Confluent Cloud, it's a tad bit nuanced where over the short term, I think what we've internally focused on is the momentum of new use cases moving into production and which was a check in Q3. So overall, we feel with the short-term drivers. But over the long term, I think, coverage of RPO to revenue to cloud revenue, that has continued to increase through the year. I mean this particular quarter was the fourth consecutive quarter of accelerated RPO that we've delivered. So yes, like from the cloud business perspective, short term is new use cases moving into production and our ability to drive growth in the new business, newer products, and long term is around the RPO. So that's going well. And for Confluent platform, absolutely, it's a leading indicator. So that's how I think about it."}

I mean, look, first of all, I think we're very pleased with the results that we brought, the strength in cloud, pleased to be in a position where we're raising guidance for Q4. I think ultimately, the cloud business has been quite strong. When you look at the growth rate for Q4, there is some impact from a particular customer. We kind of talked about that dynamic last quarter. if you normalize for that, you are seeing kind of stability in the overall cloud growth rates. So overall, we feel pretty good about that. And then when we talk about kind of some of these tailwinds some of the GSP offerings, including Flink getting to scale and starting to contribute more sizably. The overall execution within the field team around consumption and the ability to drive use cases, I think, those are positive trends."}

It's a very fair question as we added new offerings that were particularly cost effective. Is this going to be a tailwind or a headwind. I think it's proven to be a substantial tailwind. So we called out in the call that we've seen substantial improvement in overall deal size, which is maybe counterintuitive, but in fact, it's not because customers are leaning in with bigger workloads, bigger migrations that might have been harder or taken longer in the past. And because of the architecture of these offerings, the multi-tenant clusters with enterprise and freight, WarpStream with BYOC, they're very cost effective to run. So they are a tailwind to gross margin. So it's really good on both sides. It's good deal for customers, they're leaning in and going bigger. And it's a good deal for us. It's ultimately more profitable."}

So Jay, you had mentioned, I think you said more than 40% sequential growth in progressing late-stage pipeline. And it sounds very promising. I'm not sure we have historical context on that metric. Can you speak to what is driving such great traction there. And then what is the normal level of sequential growth you'd see in that late-stage pipeline?"}
{"doc_type": "earnings_call", "ticker": "CFLT", "period": "2025_Q3", "date": "2025-10-27", "section": "qa", "speaker": "Edward Kreps", "text": "Yes, yes. So yes, it's a great question. We're obviously not trying to turn that into some kind of external metric, but one of the things we set for ourselves as a benchmark of improvements in the field motion around consumption was, hey, get the new use cases, get into the new use cases, get them to production. And so we measure the dollar amount of those use cases. And we've seen that as these use cases hit production, they ramp up, they take traffic, they drive consumption in the quarters ahead. So it's a reasonable indicator to pay attention to in a forward-looking way. So yes you're asking, hey, what's the normal growth quarter over quarter? Well, over time, if you're bringing more dollars of use cases out to production, those are dollars that you're realizing in future quarters. It takes some quarters for different projects to ramp up. So it's not one is to one, but that's roughly how I would think about it. We haven't given kind of the full history of the metric, and that isn't the intention. It really is, I think, being used by us as a benchmark of execution of the field. And we felt that kind of internal metric was one of the best representations of that. We have made a number of adjustments in how folks are working these consumption projects. And I think it really has worked quite effectively."}
{"doc_type": "earnings_call", "ticker": "CFLT", "period": "2025_Q3", "date": "2025-10-27", "section": "qa", "speaker": "Mark Murphy", "text": "Okay. And then as a quick follow-up, Jay, how is the early response to the launch of streaming agents on Confluent Cloud? Because I think we would all agree, for sure, agents need access to real-time data. Frankly, they're going to look pretty unintelligent, right, and out of date if they don't have it. But then companies are -- they're so risk-averse, and they're struggling to give -- to get comfort giving agents free rein to all their data, right? It sort of scares them. And you laid out a nice -- very nice architectural vision for that, right, in the webinar, but I'm just wondering how is the customer readiness for that product? And just could you speak to -- I mean, if this takes off, can agents become pretty big in the mix a few years down the road?"}
{"doc_type": "earnings_call", "ticker": "CFLT", "period": "2025_Q3", "date": "2025-10-27", "section": "qa", "speaker": "Edward Kreps", "text": "Yes, I think that they absolutely can. So there's a few opportunities around AI for Confluent. One is around making the agents real time. One is about the provisioning of real-time data sets. Both of those are actually substantial, and you can do them both together or you can do them separately. And for those who follow us closely, we -- I mentioned in the prepared remarks that we're here in New Orleans for our conference Current, and that's in a few days. So we'll have some announcements in this space that I think we'll fill out the picture a bit more. But already, the streaming agents have caught on, we talked about one of the customer use cases in the call earlier. And it makes a lot of sense. This is a really easy way that you can run the agent on the kind of historical data, kind of benchmark it, be able to play with it almost in a batch model, but then have it translate into production and run in real time against the data that's there. It makes that kind of development much easier. And I think this is going to be a critical part of the stack. One of the things, I think, software teams are realizing is that this kind of agent development is actually a bit different from traditional software. You have to do it with the data. Traditional software, you can kind of write some program, run some unit tests against it with fake data. If that all passes, it works, you're good to go, your program is good. But these AI systems are not that way. You can build some support agent and say, oh, this answers support questions really effectively. But if you haven't tried it with the actual customer data on actual customer questions, if you're not really developing that way, you're not doing anything. And so the need is to be able to work iteratively with data, but then also launch something that will run in real time in production and be able to keep those 2 in sync as the team moves. And so I think we have really foundational capabilities. Like in many ways, that is about what streaming is, which is this ability to take some of the ideas that we had off-line with batch data processing, be able to translate them into continuous processing. And so I think it's a huge opportunity for us. In many ways, it's an acceleration of what we were doing for customers anyway. Even if the intelligence was just smart rules in a production application that was driving personalization or customization or relevance, we're already doing lots of that. And I think the AI opportunity is, in many ways, a huge generalization of that of allowing not just hard rules, but broad capabilities to access the same kind of data to make data-driven decisions, take smart actions. So hopefully, that's helpful. And stay tuned for the next couple of days, we'll have a few more announcements. It's hard to always figure out the timing of these things. But since that's 2 days later, we don't get to talk about all the new products until then."}

The -- 2 quick questions, one for Jay, one for Rohan. Jay, Flink, you gave us some extra data points. At Flink, we've been waiting for -- while I don't want to call it an inflection point, but like the uptick here. What do you see there, how customers are using it and what you're seeing in the pipeline? Does that kind of increase your optimism like talk a little bit about how that kind of translates into the business going forward? And then, Rohan, one for you. You've raised the subscription by more than the beat in Q3. Obviously, that's a good sign for Q4. What drove that? Was that kind of the one AI customer maybe doing a little bit more with you? Is that overall business doing a little bit better? Can you speak to that, sort of what gave you the confidence there?"}
{"doc_type": "earnings_call", "ticker": "CFLT", "period": "2025_Q3", "date": "2025-10-27", "section": "qa", "speaker": "Edward Kreps", "text": "Yes. I'll start with Flink that we're hugely excited. So I do think externally, this was a little bit of an unusual product development cycle because we changed our stream processing strategy and bought a Flink company, but it wasn't a Flink product. It was just the team that had built the open source. So then we were effectively starting product development with an announcement about Flink. So then we had to build the product. And I think the team has done an amazing job of that to really build a modern data -- serverless data processing layer, but do it in a way that supports high availability, real-time processing. It's a big undertaking. I think the growth of that since it's kind of reached GA and kind of got into the critical enterprise features over the last year has been spectacular. And that's absolutely as much as we could ask out of a kind of first year of selling for the product, and that trajectory remains very strong as we look ahead. So yes, we are -- I think as we've communicated as we started this effort, we think that potential for that offering over time is huge. The market for data processing is really big. There's all this stuff in these old batch jobs that needs to move into real time. And now I think we're starting to realize that opportunity. And it's an interesting intersection with the AI question as well because one of the things that actually aids these conversions is AI. So if you're converting these batch quarries to streaming queries, we have a set of capabilities to just help customers do this, just goes through and makes the little minor adjustments. I mean, largely, it's very similar. These streaming queries or SQL or similar language to the batch stuff, but of course, getting all the nuances, right? And so that's been one of the accelerants that's helped customers that are trying to go big with a lot of real-time jobs all at once, help them move faster. So yes, long story short, we're very excited about it."}
{"doc_type": "earnings_call", "ticker": "CFLT", "period": "2025_Q3", "date": "2025-10-27", "section": "qa", "speaker": "Rohan Sivaram", "text": "And Raimo, before you answer the question, I'll just add a quick point to what Jay said. From my lens, when some of these new products are ramping, I think, there are 2 things that I'd like to focus on, the breadth of adoption and the depth of adoption. For Flink, specifically, when you look at the breadth of option, we have over 1,000 paying customers for Flink. And on the depth side, we have about 12 customers spending over $100,000 in ARR and 4 customers spending $1 million in ARR. So that's actually a good position to be in and on the heels of 3 quarters or 9 months of very solid growth that we've seen. So just to add to what Jay said, we're excited about what lies ahead on that side of the business. So coming back to your question on subscription guidance for Q4. Yes, we are pleased to raise our Q4 subscription guide, and that's mostly coming from the Confluent Cloud side of the world. So if I take a step back and then analyze the Q3 performance, I'll call out 3 things. The first one is something that Jay called out in his prepared remarks. That's just the momentum of new use cases moving into production. And we saw 2 consecutive quarters of acceleration over there, so which is good. The second area is around -- we are seeing more normalized levels of optimization. I would actually put it in the category of healthy levels of optimization. So that's number two. And the third is continued strength in Flink and the cloud side of Flink. So these are some of the drivers and the momentum builders in Q3, and that's giving us confidence with respect to our Q4 cloud guidance. And I'll leave you with one more big picture thought that I touched on my first response that is these are short-term visibility drivers for the cloud business. When I take a step back and look at the long term, the RPO to cloud revenue coverage through the year has continued to increase and improve. And that's less of a Q4 visibility, but more of a slight long-term visibility, we feel good with that increasing coverage as well."}

{"doc_type": "earnings_call", "ticker": "CFLT", "period": "2025_Q3", "date": "2025-10-27", "section": "qa", "speaker": "Edward Kreps", "text": "Yes. Yes. We're seeing -- these tend to be quite broad, right? So there's similar patterns around customer support. There's patterns around anomalies and investigations. Many businesses have some operational side kind of looking for the bad thing and then diving into the bad thing that cuts across businesses that might be doing IoT, manufacturing, different production processes, but also things like retail. But even businesses, financial services, insurance, companies you might think of this being more risk averse. I think have very active projects in this area. And so I think for all of these, it's about whether they can really complete that connectivity and make it into production with these systems. We think that a big part of that is about data flow, data quality, the ability to actually iterate and test and get from something that kind of 99% works to something that 99.99% works. So it sounds like a small difference, but we operate already in a business where, operationally, the difference between 99% and 99.99% is actually a really big deal for our customers. And so you can totally see why on the quality side for any of these things. It's hard to get that last bit done. And I think why we think we're well positioned for it."}

I got 99 things right and 1 thing wrong, you remember which one. And then for Rohan, you mentioned last quarter that a large AI native company was moving to self-hosted after signing a self-managed deal in the third quarter. Any commentary on how much that large customer contributed in the third quarter? And as that large customer spend drops off from the cloud next quarter, could the self-managed portion step-up, contribute further? Just any commentary on the mechanics of that large customer deal could help?"}

First, and reiterate what I said in the Q3 call, and what we said in the Q3 call was this large customer basically made this move from Confluent cloud to on-prem. And as a result of this dynamic, their spend towards Confluent would be significantly reduced. So that's the data point. And what that would do is it would have a low single-digit impact to our Q4 cloud revenue. And Jay called out earlier, when you normalize that impact of the low single digit and you compare our Q4 guidance versus Q3 actual cloud performance, you'll see somewhat flattish year-over-year growth rate. So that kind of signs of stabilization. And specifically, that large customer, obviously contributed in Q3 from a revenue perspective and the real impact, the low single-digit impact we are going to see from our cloud business is in Q4 and that's incorporated in our guidance for Q4."}

{"doc_type": "earnings_call", "ticker": "CFLT", "period": "2025_Q3", "date": "2025-10-27", "section": "qa", "speaker": "Edward Kreps", "text": "Yes. Yes, it's quite sizable. We also, of course, are continuing to do very large open source takeouts, and there's quite a lot of the open source. But both for the open source and the CSP offerings I think one of the -- there's really 2 things that I think are making this something customers really want to take action on right away. The first is the TCO of making the change. And that comes out of the fundamentally, the improvements we've made in Kora that enable things like Enterprise Clusters, Freight Clusters. It's just something that's kind of better, faster, cheaper. And I think that's very compelling. Secondly, I think these DSP capabilities have become just a bigger and bigger part of what customers think about when they think about streaming and what they need to do to be set up to use this technology in their organization. And I think that's really quite appealing to customers making the move. So I think those 2 things are the 2 biggest needle movers. The biggest enabler, I would say, on our side, is really working on tools around migration, making it easy. I think once you have a bunch of customers that want to do it, well, this is a big live data system migration, we want to make it as easy as pushing a button, that's ongoing work to really make that easier and easier. And as I think we continue that, I think we'll see an even faster transition of these systems, which is great."}

And then as a follow-up, Rohan, in your contemplating guidance for the fourth quarter, you mentioned healthy levels of optimization. And I know this has been an issue in the first half of the year. When you -- I'd actually just to parse the question a little bit more on the comments a little bit more, is this healthy levels from prior optimizers or these net new optimizers that aren't to the same extent that you saw before. And so I guess within that question, maybe an update on optimization, is it still relevant as a headwind from the first half. And is this more a balancing active net new or kind of the whole thing in aggregate?"}

The first is, as you're entering a quarter, you're entering a quarter with a book of business and like for the existing customers, what is the growth that they are showing. And that's where optimizations generally come up. And as we've said, optimization is kind of part and parcel of every cloud business. And we want our customers to fine-tune and kind of use Confluent in a more efficient manner. That's part and parcel and that's something -- that's why I called it healthy levels of optimization. Which compares to prior historical optimizations that we've seen and which is not an outlier. So that was my comment. The second data point around how we kind of look at the business momentum is net new use cases moving into production. And the third is around adoption of new products. So when I talk about our guidance or just the momentum in Cloud business, these 3 kind of all go hand in hand. And the optimization levels to specifically answer your question, are in the ranges that we've seen historically, that is kind of more normalized and again, healthy and good optimization."}

That said, I do think some of these improvements are kind of very mechanically obviously helping things. And so I do think we've made a set of structural improvements that are paying off. The new products are obviously new products, which are kind of bringing in Flink revenue or Connect revenue or governance revenue that we would not otherwise have had in those customers. So yes, I can't ascribe it between the two. I am aware that there was kind of good results in some other providers. But we do feel like we've made some pretty important structural improvements in what we're doing."}

It is in the low single digits for us, which is good and bad, good as it's a big opportunity for us as we look ahead. And so that's great.

Of the 21 AI native customers that you guys signed over $100,000 or that are using the product for over $100,000, is there a common pattern in how they're using Confluent? Are the AI products built around Kafka or Flink? Or are there use cases similar to what you're seeing with other companies? Because that's a really, really powerful stat. I wanted to see if you could unpack it a little bit."}
{"doc_type": "earnings_call", "ticker": "CFLT", "period": "2025_Q3", "date": "2025-10-27", "section": "qa", "speaker": "Edward Kreps", "text": "Yes. So first of all, AI companies or tech companies, so they have a set of usage patterns, they're exactly like every other tech company, which is they use it for a bunch of different stuff, right? But there is a set of use cases that are common in these companies, which are very specific to AI. And that's about the flow of data about the suggestions, recommendations, actions are being taken. So I kind of touched on this briefly in the script, but the big difference in these AI systems is it is not just upfront testing. You need to do this kind of ongoing evaluation, which is really looking at what are the actions that's taken, are they good? How are we going to evaluate that? You have a bunch of different ways of doing that, including just asking humans to judge it, asking the model to judge it. But the flow of that data is really kind of right at the heart of a lot of these systems, and it's a very natural kind of streaming problem. You're going to collect that in real time, it's going to flow out maybe through table flow or other mechanisms into kind of long-term storage. You're going to be able to iterate on that. It's also a very important kind of real-time analytic in terms of how well you're doing for your customers minute-to-minute, as you're out there, if you release if you take in a new model or you make changes to your system, ultimately, are you doing better or worse with your customers? That's kind of the fundamental question. So in many of these systems, that's one of the use cases. And this is not surprising. This is a similar use case we had with more traditional machine learning use cases. I think it's just now translated into the AI era."}

And then maybe just a quick one for you, Rohan. You gave us a lot of stats that are really encouraging. RPO accelerating and the coverage ratio is improving. You talked about I think, being past kind of a peak negative optimization headwind where it's kind of stabilizing and you're talking about more visibility longer term. And you gave guidance for cloud platform revenue -- sorry, for cloud revenue for Q4, but not guidance, sorry. You gave a modeling point of being around 20%. And as I look at a year ago when -- at least for my model versus the out year, there was about a 2-point delta in that. And so I guess I know we're not guiding to or maybe even in modeling points yet for next year. But as we look at our models and that 20% exit rate, do we -- what kind of step down given some of those dynamics that are maybe headwinds for Q4 that reversed? Should we think about as we look at next year cloud revenue?"}

As we speak, we're kind of dotting the I's and crossing the T's on our fiscal year '26 plan. So I'm not going to be providing guidance either for total revenue or cloud revenue in this call. Having said that, I think, it's important to reiterate some of the data points that I shared around like, I think, you said it late-stage pipeline moving into production, the optimization levels being stabilized, normalized and which I like to call healthy, right? And the Flink driver of business, Flink has been really good. So we expect and coupled with the long-term visibility. So when you think about these and then you couple that with the low single-digit impact that we saw in Q4, which will obviously have an impact over the first half of next year, right? So those are some of the puts and takes. If I were you, I would look at as I think about fiscal year '26. But in our Q4 call, I'll be sharing a lot more color and details around our cloud revenue guidance."}

And given these drivers, our month-over-month consumption growth rates improved sequentially. And in general, going forward, I will try to avoid providing that level of detail. But specifically, we brought it up last quarter. So our month-on-month growth improved sequentially, and we were pleased with it."}

And I get that the Q3 outperformance sets the bar higher heading into Q4. But for -- I guess, one for Rohan. Does the Q4 cloud guide specifically still assume optimizations or consumption trends well below historical trends? And then when you take into consideration the large AI native customer, does it imply that NRR will be -- will decelerate versus the 114%?"}
{"doc_type": "earnings_call", "ticker": "CFLT", "period": "2025_Q3", "date": "2025-10-27", "section": "qa", "speaker": "Rohan Sivaram", "text": "Yes. So I'd say a couple of questions, so I'll break it down, Howard, to start off like we always have optimization. And that's all quarters, there is optimization. And that's why I kind of made sure that I commented around like normalized level of optimization that we saw in Q3. So that is hopefully answering the first part of your question. And when you kind of normalize the impact of the one large customer that we called out last quarter, our Q4 guidance is when you look -- compare the year-over-year growth rates, it's roughly flattish to what we saw in Q3. And from a net retention rate perspective, obviously, we are pleased with stabilization of our net retention rates. And when you think about what are the drivers, it's primarily around our stronger consumption growth that we saw, both in core streaming and DSP, both are drivers of stabilization. And from a net retention, again, I'm not going to guide for Q4 or fiscal year '26 for net retention, but I'll leave you with 2 data points. In the short term, net retention can generally fluctuate. But over the long term, some of the opportunities that we are focused on, be it core streaming, DSP, AI partner ecosystem, these are going to be the drivers of net retention rate. And all of these drivers have had positive results in Q3."}

And Rohan, given how important Flink is as a driver now, you gave the disclosure Flink low 8-figure ARR, Flink on cloud up 70% sequentially. I think if you triangulate it, you can get to maybe low single digit, call it, $2 million to $3 million of sequential increase in the cloud side. So is that fair? And should we expect that sort of sequential -- assuming that number is right, increase on the cloud side going forward, maybe as a baseline."}

Again, I'm going to stay away from providing guidance, but we are very pleased with our Flink performance. And from a Flink performance, again, I'll say because it's important to note both the breadth and the depth of our Flink performance is something that we should note. We have a lot of customers, over 1,000 customers using Flink and then we have 12 customers spending over $100,000, 4 customers spending over $1 million. And in Q3, we just reported greater than 70% quarter-over-quarter growth for that business. So we're very pleased with how the Flink business is progressing, and it will be a material contributor to Confluent Cloud in fiscal year '26."}

Maybe if I could just come back to Flink for a minute here, Jay. I am just curious to hear more maybe about some of the easy wins you're seeing with Flink customers. Some of the learnings you are applying to scale that Flink adoption across the customer base. I know we talked a lot about go-to-market and the DSP team, but any color there? And Jay, maybe just lastly, any thoughts or the feedback on how we should think about competition with Databricks structured streaming product that was announced this quarter?"}
{"doc_type": "earnings_call", "ticker": "CFLT", "period": "2025_Q3", "date": "2025-10-27", "section": "qa", "speaker": "Edward Kreps", "text": "Yes. Yes, happy to talk about both. So yes, there's actually a very broad set of use cases for Flink. If you were trying to bucket them, there's a bucket that's kind of these real-time data pipelines, getting data to some AI application or agent getting data into the analytics ecosystem, Databricks, Snowflake, cloud provider things. And then there's a set of use cases, which are acting on the data, right? Trying to predict fraud, personalize things for customers, do something smart in reaction to an event in the business. Those are the 2 kind of buckets that we see customers using. Both are actually doing quite well. And both are represented in kind of the numbers that we would overall describe. I would say some of the larger customers are customers that are kind of taking existing batch processes and converting them over. So I talked about a number of customers just doing these kind of migrations. That's obviously the most challenging to orchestrate for a new product is to really take something that's been built up over many years and kind of move it over. But we're finding that we're now at a point of maturity where we can start to do that and do it successfully with customers. So that's I think that's an exciting thing. Relative to Databricks, we remain actually very close partners working together on applications for hundreds of joint customers. We're providing a set of real-time data that often flows as their environment. There are some overlaps and capabilities in both what we're doing and what they're doing. I think in practice, we tend to serve different constituencies. We tend to have more kind of real-time operational application systems, software engineers, they would tend to have more data engineers, analytics, data scientists, type user base. But for sure, there's some things that you could do in either product. On the whole though, I think we've been pretty complementary in going to market together. And even though that kind of overlapping feature set may increase, I think that will remain the case. Ultimately, customers have chosen us for that real-time hub of integration for data and many customers have chosen Databricks as the kind of lake destination where all the data goes for historical analysis. And so ultimately, customers want those things to work together, we're happy to serve them together."}

{"doc_type": "earnings_call", "ticker": "CFLT", "period": "2024_Q2", "date": "2024-07-31", "section": "prepared", "speaker": "Jay Kreps", "text": "Thanks, Shane. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to our second quarter earnings call. I'm pleased to report a solid second quarter, once again exceeding our revenue and margin guidance despite a continuing volatile macro environment. Subscription revenue grew 27% to $225 million, Confluent Cloud revenue grew 40% to $117 million, and non-GAAP operating margin was positive, representing approximately 10 percentage points of improvement. These results underscore the power of our data streaming platform and our relentless focus on delivering success for our customers. Today, I'll start with providing an update on our consumption transformation. Overall, the vast majority of rollout towards our transformation to becoming consumption-oriented is complete, a step change in how we run our Cloud business. One success indicator for our transformation is new logo growth. I'm pleased to share that we increased our total customer count by 320 in Q2, double from the previous quarter and representing our largest sequential increase in two years. In addition to landing a higher volume of customers, we believe we have increased the quality. A strong focus on our target accounts has increased the percentage of high propensity customer lands. Though this new consumption motion lands them earlier in their journey, we believe over time, many of these customers will represent the next wave of high consumption accounts for us. We remain as confident as ever in the strategic position of the company and the prospects for durable long-term growth. We have the industry-leading technology in an increasingly critical and relevant category that we believe will be as important databases. Over the past year, we've made a series of innovations to build out the full set of capabilities of a data streaming platform, enabling us to capture the full life cycle data in motion. And as we progress along our consumption transformation, we will be better equipped than ever to rapidly acquire new customers, win new workloads and fuel the adoption of our full set of product capabilities. Our rapid pace of innovation and ability to land high-quality customers who have the potential to consume more of our product leaves me more excited than ever about the long-term opportunity to capture the lion's share of the data streaming market. Vimeo, a leading SaaS video platform with over 260 million users, is a great example of a customer using our complete data streaming platform. Success for video platforms like Vimeo largely depend on delivering stellar user experiences, but traditional data warehousing and batch ETL processes limited their ability to see real-time customer usage, hindering timely decisions, quick pivots on products and campaigns and adaptive user experiences without buffering. So they tuned to Confluent to enable real-time data flows that provided the visibility they lacked. Fully managed connectors to Snowflake, S3 and others make it easy to instantly connect data through their business without the hassle of building and self-managing connectors. Stream Governance ensures data quality and security and allows Vimeo to safely scale and share data streams. And the team is looking towards Flink to enhance their streaming use cases while freeing up bandwidth across the team. With Confluent and real-time data flows, Vimeo can make quick decisions and deliver top quality personalized experiences that drive growth and profitability. Next, I'd like to discuss the critical role our partners play in our business and some exciting announcements in this area. Partners are essential to our strategy to expand our reach into new markets, improve sales efficiency and complement our data streaming platform. We're pleased to share a number of notable achievements and milestones across all three pillars of our partner ecosystem. In Q2, we announced Build with Confluent and Accelerate with Confluent, which makes it easier for our global SI partners like KPMG, Accenture and EY to build specialized offerings as they embed data streaming into their core business. A wide range of use cases have already been established through the Build with Confluent program, including a gen AI bot for airline customer support, fraud detection against AI-powered voice phishing, automated limit increases for credit card users and real-time telemetry analysis for freight optimization. We're also seeing great traction with Connect Confluent, a technology partner program that makes it easier for partners to build data integrations with Confluent Cloud. In Q2, we crossed more than 40 technology and partner built integrations, including SAP, MongoDB, Imply and services at Google Cloud and AWS, giving us coverage across the major segments of the modern data and AI stack to help us drive consumption of Confluent. The success of Connect with Confluent has tripled the amount of data traffic from our partner integration since the start of the year. And finally, on the CSP front, we were pleased to be recognized as Partners of the Year by both Google and Microsoft. This marks the third year in a row that Confluent won this award from Microsoft and the fifth year that we've been recognized by Google. Together, these recognitions underscore our highly valuable and symbiotic relationship with our cloud partners. As we discussed last quarter, data streaming plays a critical role in fueling gen AI applications with contextual and trustworthy streams of real-time data. This was underscored by our 2024 data streaming report. 90% of the 4,000-plus IT leaders we surveyed said data streaming platforms can lead to more product and service innovation in AI and ML development, with 63% saying data streaming platforms significantly fuel AI progress by building a real-time data foundation. I'm pleased to share couple of examples of this. A top five mortgage lender in the United States is turning to Confluent and gen AI to reimagine home buying experience. This company uses generative AI to listen to client calls, transcribe them, analyze sentiment and record client patterns and preferences to create personalized experiences for millions of customers and prospects. They turn to Confluent as a key part of their RAG-enabled architecture to quickly build and scale gen AI use cases by tapping into readily usable trustworthy data streams. Connectors allow them to connect data and systems from across lines of business, while Stream Governance and Stream Processing enabled the team to create reusable data products that are easy to find, understand and use. As a result of their gen AI initiatives, approximately 70% of servicing calls can be fully self-served without the need for full team member intervention. By saving the client servicing team 40,000 hours annually, team members can concentrate on cultivating strong, meaningful client relationships, while AI manages the mundane tasks. But this is just the start. In the future, their gen AI platform will earn homeowners' preferences and communication habits, so that team members can anticipate and solve clients' needs. An international e-commerce company in n Germany with €16 billion annual sales is another example of companies turning to Confluent to play a key role in their Gen AI stack. When e-commerce products from this company's iconic brands are promoted, their call centers received massive spikes in call volume. But with only 100 call center reps, customers are often left in long wait queues, leading to failed convergence and unhappy customers. So they turn to Confluent to help power Gen AI applications like voice bots that can scale up in seconds and answer 1,000 calls in parallel. As customers interact with these voice bots, an AI order entry bot enables the order completion process and communicates with ERP systems in real time via Confluent, streaming transactional data such as product, order, customer, payment and billing information. A key part of this workflow is Confluent's streaming KPIs from bots in the operational domain to their analytical systems, capturing data like real-time orders, call metrics, sentiment analysis, and how many AI tokens were used to analyze and measure the efficacy of calls to continuously make their bots smarter and more effective. Powered by enriched trusted data streams from Confluent, this e-commerce company can now handle unexpected traffic spikes to increase call center capacity on demand to reduce customer wait times and improve order completion rate. In closing, we're excited about the trajectory we're on. With our complete data streaming platform and our transition to a consumption-oriented business, we’re well positioned to attract more customers who can drive even more value from Confluent, as they capture the full life cycle of streaming data from our platform. The future of Confluent is incredibly bright. With that, I'll turn it over to Rohan."}
{"doc_type": "earnings_call", "ticker": "CFLT", "period": "2024_Q2", "date": "2024-07-31", "section": "prepared", "speaker": "Rohan Sivaram", "text": "Thanks, Jay. Good afternoon, everyone. In Q2, we delivered solid subscription revenue growth and substantial margin expansions, ending the quarter with positive non-GAAP operating margin and free cash flow margin. These results, coupled with continued adoption of our data streaming platform, demonstrate our relentless focus on driving long-term efficient growth in a volatile macro environment. Turning to the Q2 results. Subscription revenue grew 27% to $224.7 million, exceeding the high end of our guidance and representing 96% of total revenue. Confluent Platform revenue growth accelerated to 16%, ending the quarter at $107.3 million and accounting for 48% of subscription revenue. We closed two 8-figure multiyear deals consisting of renewal and expansion with existing customers in the financial services industry. This underscores Confluent as the platform of choice for data streaming among the world's most established enterprises. Confluent Cloud revenue grew 40% to $117.4 million and accounted for 52% of subscription revenue compared to 47% in the year ago quarter. We are pleased with delivering high growth at scale and continuing to improve the margin profile for our cloud business. Turning to the geographic mix of total revenue. Revenue from the US grew 26% to $143.2 million. Revenue from outside the US grew 22% to $91.7 million. Moving on to rest of the income statement. I'll be referring to non-GAAP results, unless stated otherwise. Subscription gross margin was 80.8%, up 170 basis points. Gross margin performance was driven by strong Confluent platform and improving unit economics of our Confluent Cloud offering. Turning to profitability and cash flow. Operating margin expanded 9.7 percentage points to 0.6%, representing our eighth consecutive quarter of 9 points or more in margin improvement. Operating margin performance was driven by our gross margin performance and our continued focus on driving efficient growth across the company. Net income per share was $0.06 for Q2 using 354.2 million diluted weighted average shares outstanding. Fully diluted share count under the treasury stock method was approximately 362.9 million. Free cash flow margin turned positive and improved approximately 20 percentage points to 1.2% and we ended second quarter with $1.93 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities. Turning now to other business metrics. Total customer count was approximately 5,440, up 320 customers sequentially, our largest sequential growth in growth in two years. We are pleased with accelerating total customer count and the quality of customers we have acquired. Additionally, we added 46 customers with 100,000 plus in ARR and nine customers in 1 million plus in ARR, bringing the total to 1,306 and 177, respectively. Our 100,000-plus ARR customers continue to contribute greater than 85% of our revenue. Our new $1 million-plus ARR customers include customers from a variety of industries, including energy, financial services, manufacturing, retail, transportation and more. Turning to NRR. Q2 NRR was 118%, below our target range of 120% to 125% for this year. This was due to continuing consumption volatility within our large digital-native customer base. After the stabilization in Q1 and a healthy start in Q2, we saw increased short-term cloud cost controls and focus on driving efficiencies in this customer cohort in the month of June, which impacted expansion of new use cases. While the green shoots we saw earlier this year haven't yet translated to the level of consumption we had expected, we are pleased to see continued strength in our gross retention rate. GRR remained above 90% at a level consistent with the last two quarters, reflecting the sticky nature of our data streaming platform and our continued focus on delivering strong value and ROI to our customers. As we frame our guidance for the second half of 2024, there are two points I would like to call out before getting into the numbers. First, growth of our Confluent Platform business remains lumpy, driven by the timing of large renewal and expansion deals. As a reminder, approximately 20% of our Confluent Platform TCV is recognized as upfront license revenue. This could create short-term variability for growth in Confluent Platform. Q2 was a good example where we benefited from this dynamic, which creates a tough compare for growth for rest of 2024. Second, consumption in our digital-native customer base remains volatile. As mentioned, while the green shoots we saw over the last few months continue to take hold, they have not yet translated to the level of consumption we had expected. We have incorporated this consumption dynamic from our large digital-native customers into our second half outlook. Now, let's turn to guidance. For the third quarter of 2024, we expect subscription revenue to be in the range of $233 million to $234 million, representing growth of approximately 23% to 24%; non-GAAP operating margin to break even, representing improvement of approximately 5 percentage points; and non-GAAP net income per diluted share to be $0.05. For the full year 2024, we expect subscription revenue to be approximately $910 million, representing growth of approximately 25%; non-GAAP operating margin to breakeven, representing improvement of approximately seven percentage points, non-GAAP net income per diluted share to be $0.20; and free cash flow margin to break even, representing improvement of approximately 16 percentage points. Looking out longer term, we remain well-positioned to address our market opportunity. As Jay pointed out earlier, we're going after a highly strategic and mission-critical data streaming market, which we believe will be as important as databases. Over the last few decades, history in software has repeated itself many times that platform approach wins. Our industry-leading data streaming platform is the only complete platform spanning stream, connect, process and govern, enabling us to capture the full life cycle of data in motion at a lower TCO and delivering strong ROI to our customers. In Q2, we saw continued adoption of our data streaming platform. Connect, process and govern of our DSP portfolio accounted for a larger portion of cloud revenue and grew substantially faster than our overall cloud business. Multi-product customers remained our fastest-growing customer cohort with NRR substantially higher than 130%. We believe DSP will continue to outgrow our core business for the foreseeable future. And as it continues to scale, DSP is expected to be a strong growth tailwind to our business over a long period of time. Additionally, the rise of GenAI makes it clear that a modern organization success is significantly influenced by its data strategy, particularly around data and motion. With a complete cloud native and ubiquitous platform and secular tailwinds for data in motion, we have never been more confident in our ability to sustain durable and efficient growth over the long-term. In closing, we are pleased with our solid second quarter results. As we continue to execute on our consumption transformation, we remain focused on driving efficient growth and delivering breakeven for non-GAAP operating margin and free cash flow margin for 2024. Now Jay and I will take your questions."}

Guys, I'm in the airport. So hopefully the background noise is okay. Jay, I noticed the strong customer logo adds stood out to me.

So one of the measures we -- first of all, I would say, as we undertook this consumption transformation, one of our key goals was to accelerate customer acquisition. So that's played out as we desired. The second thing that we were aiming for was a little more targeted in which customers we're landing in. And so we built a model to try to predict the opportunity in these customers and tagged a set of accounts we felt were high propensity. So the measure we use internally is what percentage of these new customer lands are in that high propensity segment. And so obviously, it's on us to go drive the growth in the accounts. But one of the things we think is promising is that that percentage has gone up substantially when we look at the first half of this year versus last year in the customers we're landing in."}

You noted some of the NRR pressure and the potential for lumpy Confluent Platform business in the second half. It seems like that's contemplated in your guidance. I guess, I'm curious, after you saw -- it sounds like a little bit of slowness in June. How do things trend in July? I mean have you seen things kind of stabilized a bit? Or just maybe a little bit more on the linearity on the cloud side. Thanks."}

I mean, from an overall guidance perspective, as you rightly pointed out, we've considered two factors: our Confluent Platform business tends to be lumpy, primarily because of how the rev rec is and the timing of some of the larger deals. So that's incorporated in the guide. And the second 1 that you mentioned was around the digital native customers. So for digital native customers, Q1, we saw stabilization. And as we entered Q2, we did see a continuation of that stabilization. However, I would say towards the latter half of the quarter, we did see cost efficiencies and focus on just driving some cost efficiencies from some of these customers, which actually continued into the month of July. So as we think of the back half of the year, we think taking a thoughtful and prudent approach to guidance would be the right thing to do."}

I want to turn back to the sort of go-to-market transformation. I think there was an approach to utilize similar sales motions like MongoDB, who've done monitoring cloud sales. One of the things that they have been seeing is that as they try and incent for more volume and higher volumes of workloads, the quality 12 months down the road wasn't what they expected. I was wondering, Jay -- I'm happy to see the new customer logos really accelerate. But if you look at it on a workload basis, how are you guys thinking about ensuring quality of the workloads and not just seeing that increased volume?"}

That's obviously on us to ensure that we're kind of getting the growth and expansion out of this customer set. The first indication is just are we getting into the right customer. So I think that, we've seen. As we think about over the course of this year, we want to see those grow. Part of our objective was definitely to get into customers earlier in the life cycle, earlier in the development life cycle where they're actually setting up the architecture where they can use more of our DSP in the first application they're planning. I think that's been successful, and that's allowed us to take up the volume of customers. But yes, really showing how those play out and spill into the $100,000-plus, $1 million-plus, that will happen over time."}

How are you guys thinking about when look at the pieces of a real time on data infrastructure, I think OpenAI bought what's called like a real-time database.

We actually partner very closely with a number of providers similar functionality. So I think Rockset was the company that OpenAI announced having bought. There's probably half a dozen to a dozen companies in that segment where they're taking streams of data and serving different types of queries against those streams. And that's a great set of partners for us. And we work with them around a whole set of applications, including some in the Gen AI space, use cases around search, use cases use cases around real-time analytics, around aggregating and storing other key information sets that power workloads. So there's definitely kind of a nice integration there between some the real-time databases or streaming databases and the rest of the streaming platform."}

Thank you."}

So yes, we did have one departure on the sales side. The structure of our team is the larger field effort, the reps, technical folks, BD folks, consulting, who's all under Erica Schultz. So she's kind of at the top of the sales organization and reports to me. She remains in charge of that, and she has been at Confluent for over four years. So there's a fair amount of continuity. Under her, the managers, management structure the reps just kind of bounced back and forth between something where she manages the individual theater leaders like APAC or EMEA directly. Or as somebody who manages that set of theater leaders. And so we did make a change in that structure. I won't comment on the departure in detail, but we're not planning on immediately backfilling it. We're comfortable with the arrangement we've had. And that's worked well for us in the past, and we feel good about that in the near term. On Flink, yes, it continues to go well. This is a time of excitement from our customers. I think last quarter, we said on the order of around 600 prospects and customers that tried it out. That's up to over 1,000 now. We're starting to see really nice growth in the revenue from that. But of course, it's still early days, small numbers. What we want to see is see that ramp to a larger percentage of the business, see more the kind of large-scale production use cases come online. That's what we're looking for over course of this year. And if we're successful in that, that will be a very positive tailwind for the business overall as it gets to a larger portion of the business heading into next year."}

And great to see the progress in new logo and the path to profitability. Rohan, you characterize digital native customers as volatile. What's the behavior that you're seeing specifically? Are they down selling? Or are they churning? And is this more cloud or Confluent platform? How much of a risk is this going forward and the extent to which you're embedding in the guide?"}
{"doc_type": "earnings_call", "ticker": "CFLT", "period": "2024_Q2", "date": "2024-07-31", "section": "qa", "speaker": "Rohan Sivaram", "text": "Yes. Thanks for the question, Brad. I mean, when you look at the digital native segment and customers and if you zoom out look at it over a longer period of time, the growth has been linear. And our growth has been upward, but not linear. So over a period of time, the segment, we've seen good growth, and the growth rates have been higher than the rate of company. But when you really look at the last 12-odd months, this segment has been under some kind of cost efficiency pressure. And you do see every now and then customers just focusing on the cost side of it and then adding more workloads. So that is a trend that we've seen. But the big takeaway from my perspective is if you step back and look at it over a longer period of time, this segment has been actually a good grower for us. And that's a long-term outlook. But as you think about how we saw the month of June, we thought it's just prudent to bake it into our second half outlook as we look ahead."}

I mean, when we step back and think about the digital-native segment, overall, we remain very optimistic that that's an area that's grown for us very nicely over the last few years, and we think we'll continue that way. But as Rohan said, yes, there is probably more cost pressure there, and that does mean that if we look at Q1 to Q2, we did see different performance in that segment between those two quarters where we saw outsized growth in Q1 and a little bit more optimization in Q2. And I think that's kind of the of the balance those two forces. We expect that to play out in second half of the year as well."}

I just want to ask about go-to-market. It seems like it's been a bit of an evolution over the last several years, and you guys are still kind of figuring it out. Beyond the change to consumption and the management structure that you alluded to, what else would you call out that you've learned that could help move the needle on your go-to-market motion and where the best bang for the buck investments are going forward?"}

If I think about the first half of this year, it was mostly that shift to consumption. It's kind of rebuilding what you had on a new foundation around a different set metrics, oriented on something new. If I think about the balance of year and beyond, it's really taking advantage of that structure. I do think that's the right setup for type of cloud infrastructure company that we are. If you look at both peer companies and what the cloud providers have done over time to drive growth of workload, it really hinges around that. And so I feel good about the progress we've made and some of the early results from that. But I think it's even more exciting when we think about how we can use that to drive the adoption of these expansion product areas and the expansion of new workloads in the customer base."}

Yes, if I think about what we've shown, we've kind of taken up the volume of lands, but we will be catching these kind of earlier in the build cycle.

Jay, in terms of the new motions of cross-selling DSP to the base, can you talk about what parts of that portfolio are seeing the strongest uptake when you look at governance, connectors, processors? Is there anything you'd highlight getting more traction? And when you sell into a core customer, what's often the ASP uplift when you cross-sell one of those components?"}
{"doc_type": "earnings_call", "ticker": "CFLT", "period": "2024_Q2", "date": "2024-07-31", "section": "qa", "speaker": "Jay Kreps", "text": "Yes. Yes, it's a good question. Yes, I would think of each of those products as being in a kind of S-curve, where it's on some ramp. The earliest of those was our connector ecosystem where we continue to make improvements and drive growth with it. We think there's a lot of opportunity there. The governance portfolio was next, and Flink is the newest addition to that. And so I think there's interest and traction around all three, but Connect is the bigger business out of those three just because it started earlier. When we think about kind of percentage growth, course, you see the highest percentage off Flink because it's starting from the small space. And so we want to continue to ramp all three of those, but we expect the attach from those components to increase quite substantially in the year ahead as we open that up to more customers. What drives that is, in part, maturity of the product, a lot of the security, private networking functionality, other things that are important for our largest revenue customers to use those components are either just added or just being added over the course of this year, and that really opens up a lot more of the large-scale production usage to the rest of our customer base and so that's a critical focus for us when we think about the balance of the year."}

We shared a little bit of kind of sketch of the shape that business so far. I think, to be honest, I think it's still early days as these components ramp, even a customer that's adopted connectors. There's more of them they can use. Even if they have their first few Flink queries, we would like to take over a substantial portion of their applications in the stream processing layer. And so I wouldn't think of that as a dynamic uplift of like, oh, you'll see x-percent and it's binary, either on or off. I would see this is kind of unlocking an adoption cycle that drives growth not just in core Kafka, but now in these components as well, which will themselves produce more growth in the underlying Kafka usage."}

Rohan, for you. Last quarter, I think you highlighted targets of getting to 125% NRR next year.

Derrick, I mean when I really look at the medium-term, as Jay highlighted right now, the outlook has not changed at all. I'll basically talk about three things. First, data streaming platform. And as Jay just pointed out, the products within our data streaming platform, be it connect, stream processing or Flink or governance, they are all early stages of adoption. And 2025 is going to be the year where there is going to be monetization and material contribution to revenue. The second is around consumption transformation. By the time we finish the year, we'll have completed a full year of the transformation and a full year of fine-tuning our go-to-market all things consumption. So we expect to get a tailwind from that. And the third category is GenAI. We've been talking to customers and Jay highlighted also in his prepared remarks, real-time data is going to be a key component and key part of this broader ecosystem. So when you really take a step back and look at some of these drivers and vectors of growth, our view around NRR getting back to our medium-term targets has not changed."}

Rudy, candidly, not a whole lot read into it. When you see the relative, I would say, difference in growth rates between international and U.S., more often than not, the driver is timing of some of these larger Confluent platform deals. And I mean, Q2 was exactly the same. We called out two large 8-figure deals. Both of the deals were in North America and hence, the delta, I would say, a relative difference in the growth rates. So, not a whole lot to call out. On the sales attrition, I'd say, again, no specific trends that we'd like to call out. Just two prop comments I'll make on that front. First is, as we kind of went through the consumption transformation, obviously, as we stand right now reflecting back, we feel really good with the overall sales capacity we have on board. The first half of the year, we've had strong hiring from a sales organization perspective. And that just sets us well as we look ahead for rest of the year, I'd say we have right capacity in place to deliver on our forecast."}

I know you guys are guiding to just total subscription revenue. It sounds like platform base is probably tough comparing second half versus first half maybe down a bit in Q3. Do I have that right? And secondly, on cloud revenue, just any directional color you can give on the sequential expectations in cloud? It sounds like it may be some of the headwinds in June and July, maybe the sequential add in Q3 is a bit lower than Q2?"}

If it's not covered, let me know, right? Well, when we look at the second half guidance, I'll say I called out two drivers. The first is around Confluent Platform. And in general, when you have these large deals, the timing of these deals matter. And the timing of these deals, not only from a renewal perspective, but also from an expansion perspective. Renewals tend to be a lot more predictable than the expansions. And hence, my comment around the second half with respect to platform. On Confluent Cloud side, again, what we are essentially modeling out is, we're thinking that at the dynamics that we saw in the digital native customer segment will kind of continue into the second half. So, yes, starting this quarter, we've obviously stopped guiding total revenue and the focus will be on subscription revenue. But just to help with the transition from an overall modeling point perspective, we expect cloud mix for the full year as a percentage of total subscription revenue to be approximately 53%, in that ZIP code. And that's very consistent with the mix that I shared earlier in year. So not a whole lot has changed, but I just wanted to provide that color as you think about the second half, Rudy."}

It's great to be on with you. I guess, maybe just on the first one, on the digital natives, if you can kind of dig in a little bit there on maybe -- did you see was the moderation in consumption or some of the, I would say, modulation of the green shoots. Was that tied to a particular vertical, a particular geography? We talked -- we heard Microsoft last night talk about how some consumption trends were less than they expected in Europe. So just curious if you could maybe categorize where some of those modulations came from?"}

I don't think that's the main thing. We actually saw this primarily in the larger set of digital native customers globally. So US, EMEA, et cetera. And what is it they're doing? It's not the case that they're cutting projects. It's not the case that they're switching to competitors or there's any kind of customer loss in that segment. It really was about optimizing their use of the underlying infrastructure. And so in a lot of these customers, they have a built-out team that's FinOps or something like that that's kind of scrutinizing costs and working with infrastructure teams to figure out, hey, can we consolidate clusters across teams? Can we compress data more? What can we do to squeeze a little bit more juice out of each dollar of cloud spend is not unique to Confluent, but we did see a little bit more of that activity. Any quarter in that segment is a balance of that kind of optimization and expansion. We think about last quarter, the balance was definitely on the expansion side this quarter, a little bit more on the optimization side. That means when we think about rest of the year, could play out either way, but we're factoring in more risk when we think about what we'll get out of that segment."}

And then maybe the second one, super helpful, by the way, help on the cloud revenue component for the second half. But maybe like given the fact that you're signing more customers that you're landing maybe a little bit smaller initially, you've got these -- a number of product vectors starting to gain traction with Flink and a few others. And then presumably, some of these GenAI use cases ramping, is there the possibility that even though the second half implied guidance for subscription, for cloud, there is a bit of deceleration in that guide to account for the conservatism. How do we think about sequencing of those tailwinds to maybe drive reacceleration? Again, I'll point to Microsoft, who told us second half of their fiscal year, they're going to see Azure reaccelerate."}

It would be, I think, early to start describing next year. But just broadly or qualitatively, as we add into that, yes, we feel like there's substantial tailwinds and all the things you just mentioned. I think we'll start to contribute more materially and that's definitely a positive factor for us. And then when we just talk to customers, I think this is an area they continue to really bet on and invest in and that's increasingly for these larger customers becoming a very substantive part of their overall data infrastructure.

So Jay, the motivation behind the transition to consumption was to ultimately get better growth rate acceleration, which was the right thing do. So as you are halfway through the mark of the year, what are the things that you've uncovered as unlocks, what are the things that are working, things that still need work? Because when you look at the -- fit were to accelerate, which I think is definitely the goal of the company and certainly the right thing, we should be starting to see some leading indicators get better. And maybe it's not the right way to look at the subscription revenue growth or the cloud revenue growth, which have been slowing down a bit, right? Maybe due to a whole host of all reasons. While your lands are certainly very impressive. So what needs to happen more for the transition to unlock the real growth potential of the company, which is the acceleration that you have planned for some time in calendar 2025? And I have a follow-up question. Thank you so much."}

I mean obviously, when we look at the performance any year, there's a number of factors in play, including just the fact that we're changing a lot of things in the go-to-market. The first step is kind of get back to where you were in the new system. And I feel like, hey, we've kind of done that. It doesn't mean that everything is dramatically better, but it means we're now oriented around consumption, tracking each of the individual workloads in each customer, tracking the actual spend by component and the opportunities around that, which is what will drive DSP growth. So that's a good foundation to build on. So what is it that we need to do? We need to really harness that and lean into it as the driver of growth. And I think that will be a positive tailwind for us as we kind of head into next year. As well all the customers we've landed. The nice thing is, hey, as we think about halfway into this year, we actually have a much broader base to grow out of in terms of new lands and provided we're able to continue that throughout the second half of the year. Heading into next year, that's kind of a cohort to drive growth that will be kind of coming towards the more production maturity, additional use cases, et cetera, and that will be a challenge."}

So as you have the net expansion rates. I mean, certainly, they came down a bit. But broadly speaking, they're still okay relative to the overall growth rate of the company. Does it mean that you could get more profitability because generating growth within the base is less costly, less time consuming than going for growth outside? Or are there other puts and takes that offset that consideration, netting out on where you stand in terms of profitability and good net expansion as a driver of better profitability?"}
{"doc_type": "earnings_call", "ticker": "CFLT", "period": "2024_Q2", "date": "2024-07-31", "section": "qa", "speaker": "Rohan Sivaram", "text": "Yeah. I mean, Kash, thanks for your question. Higher net expansion rates and net retention rates are obviously a driver of leverage over a long period of time. So there's no question about it. But when I really -- I'll probably take the question in two lenses. First, when you double click into net retention in addition to the current trends that you see, we spoke about data streaming platform. And for customers that are using multiproducts for us, then net retention rates are well above 130%. So as you think about the next wave of growth, next vector of growth, that's going to be a tailwind to net retention rates. So that's one piece of piece of it. The second it, around the margin side. I mean, when we think about our resource allocation philosophy, it is always making sure you get the right balance between growth and profitability and you're driving efficient over a long period of time. And that's our goal. Given the opportunities that we have in 2025 and beyond with respect to the new growth vectors, we're being prudent about it. When you look at the second half, we'll be adding the right amount of capacity in engineering, in sales and marketing to make sure we are ready, and we are in the right position from an overall capacity perspective as we embark on next year. I mean, most of the hiring we're going to do between now and end of the year is going to benefit us next year. And I'll finish up by saying our medium-term goals from an operating margin perspective, which is in the ZIP code of 5% to 10%, continues to be the same. And we're going to manage that proactively by balancing both growth and profitability."}

One question for you, I'll just blurt both of them out. On the Flink market, as you try to kind of execute towards capturing the Flink opportunity, how does the maturity in kind of the understanding the use cases compare to that of the coal market? I'm trying to understand if you're finding customers that have well-defined Flink use cases and there's a pent-up demand versus the use cases are not as defined that of the core Kafka market, and there's a little bit of evangelization that maybe needs to happen. That's the first question. And second question, how big is the digital native segment for you? Thank you."}
{"doc_type": "earnings_call", "ticker": "CFLT", "period": "2024_Q2", "date": "2024-07-31", "section": "qa", "speaker": "Jay Kreps", "text": "Yes. I would think about Flink as being maybe as an open source project, call it, maybe three years behind Kafka, broadly. And so in terms of maturity, that's probably where it is. Does that mean customers have use cases or don't use cases? Well, it depends on the customer, right? Typically, the way these technologies progress is from more technologically sophisticated companies to less technologically sophisticated companies. And so in maybe some of the banks, digital native companies, they would have pretty mature Flink practices, maybe not as large scale as their Kafka usage, but certainly up and running. You get out further into mainstream enterprise, you'd see some of that, but maybe less, right? And so I would think about that as being kind of the vector diffusion and very similar to Kafka usage. I think it follows a very similar pattern, but several years earlier in that flow. For us, I think the project is a lot easier than the initial Kafka land. If you think about what we had to do getting into these new accounts with a cloud offering, especially early on, a lot of these customers did not have a lot of cloud products for infrastructure outside of the cloud provider. So that kind of initial land was definitely the harder lift. As you think about, okay, great, now they've got these streams of data expansion to things that use the stream data, I think it's definitely easier than kind of getting Kafka in the first time. And I think that's a positive for us for getting that product to ramp quickly. And so we think that's a positive thing. And remind me of the second question you had?"}

Can you tell me what percent of your platform revenue is associated with cloud customers as well? I'm just trying to think because if there's a significant overlap there, we think that over time, the lumpiness -- inherent lumpiness in platform would fade. So we'll love to get color on that."}

Well, we've not broken that out, but what I can tell you is there is increasing set of customers who are using both Platform and Confluent Cloud. And a couple of quarters back, we've been kind also providing updates that when customers have both Cloud and Platform, they tend to be more sticky and their NRRs are higher than the company average NRRs as well. So that's one piece of it. But your other point around -- if you have both Platform and Cloud, the lumpiness will come down. Probably not always because some -- most of these times, you do have complementary use cases that are working in parallel. So, when a time for a platform renewal actually comes, there is an event that happens that drives upfront revenue recognition. That doesn't change. So, the lumpiness will still be there. But I think to answer your question, yes, there is a growing number of customers that are using both Platform and Cloud. And actually, that's exactly the direction we want to go because that makes our customers a lot more stickier."}

Rohan, you did a nice job explaining some of the deliberation by the digital native customers and what you're assuming going forward. That said, you beat Q2 subscription revenue by about $7 million, guided in line for Q3, which implies a fairly meaningful Q4 reduction. So, I did just want to ask if either of these large deals closed sooner than you had expected? Or if there's anything you're seeing in the pipeline that has caused you to be a little more cautious with respect to the Q4 specifically?"}

In general, you have Confluent Platform, large deals that are either renewals and expansions and new deals. For the renewals, it's fairly predictable. You have visibility 12 months down the road when that's going to happen. And more often than not, it ends up kind of in that ZIP code. For the newer deals and for the expansion deals, that's where you could see deals kind of shift one quarter plus/minus. And that's the dynamic that basically I called out for the second half guidance. And it's also important to note is that our backdrop of what continues to be a fairly volatile macro environment. And we want to be -- we want to make sure that we are thoughtful and prudent with respect to as we think about the outlook. On the Confluent Cloud side, again, not a whole lot of new things to share, but we are basically assuming that the dynamics that we saw towards the end of Q2 will kind of have impact to the second half of the year."}

And then just for Jay, can you walk through the rationale of switching Confluent Cloud pricing for your basic and standard clusters from based on partitions previously to elastic CKUs? And then also, does this change have any impact on revenue over the remainder of 2024?"}
{"doc_type": "earnings_call", "ticker": "CFLT", "period": "2024_Q2", "date": "2024-07-31", "section": "qa", "speaker": "Jay Kreps", "text": "Yes. We made a set of pricing changes. Those were some of them. There was also some tune-ups on some of the throughput related pricing, some of the connector pricing. We talked a little bit about that a few earnings back as being kind of aligned with this consumption transformation. So, in general, we were looking at things, that cost friction early in the buying process and we're kind of more aligned to a big upfront purchase than they were to a kind of use case-by-use case expansion and we wanted to pull some of that out. If you think about what we're trying to do broadly, there's a lot of open source Kafka usage out there. We've monetized a small percentage of it, mostly sitting out there and open source, we want to go get it. There's a bunch of things we do to make that happen. But part of what want to do is really cover the spectrum of kind of TCO needs. There are very high volume, very price-sensitive workloads. There's very premium, high-quality workloads. You actually need some different SKUs to actually segment that market and go after it in the best way. So if you think about the additions to our portfolio, both the new offerings in Kafka for very large scale, some of the tuning at the low end. It really is about trying to properly segment that market and go capture it to kind of soak up more of the world. Kafka, I think has proven successful in part, as evidenced by the higher volume of customer lands, I mean part of that kind of comp and sales practice thing, but part of it is also changes in the product that make it easier to land. Does it have impact on revenue? Yes, it does have some. Whenever any of these things that kind of give customers more options, it does give them more opportunity to shift around. When we look at that, that effectively came out as expected. So we had some model of like, hey, how much shift are we going to see. Typically, what you see when you make one of these changes is initially, some shift that may be a little bit negative. And then kind of better expansion as you have more options for customers to plug into. And so when we were checking ourselves against the model we built in terms of the impact of that, it was more or less exactly what we expected. When you take it all together, of course, individual changes might be a little bit more or less. So the change on those SKUs was not a part of that larger vision, which is like simplification, friction reduction and just kind of soaking up all the Kafka. Is that helpful?"}

So even internally, we break that into kind of large tech companies and smaller tech companies. What we saw was more concentrated on these large tech companies that are kind of more actively pursuing optimization. For those customers, yes, they do tend to operate at scale. They have a lot of engineers. They tend to move quicker than the average customer in terms of adoption and expansion, but also in terms of optimization, they're just a little bit more agile than a similarly sized company elsewhere in enterprise. That's probably broadly how I would characterize it. Their kind of use cases aren't vastly different from the rest of the world. They just tend to have a bit more data and somewhat more engineers than the average company that size."}

I haven't looked at the tech composition specifically broken out, so I couldn't give you more color on that, but I'm not aware of that being a factor. And then yeah, we are catching these use cases earlier. It's just easier in this consumption motion for us to land. We're more flexible on the commitment amount. The product is better optimized for that. The comp is incentivizing it. And so yeah, it is easier for us to get in early. But the key thing for us will be to kind of show that ramp of consumption over the course of the year with these new customers. What we've seen so far is promising, both in terms of the numbers and that ramp time. I don't think it will be exactly the same amount per customer, but the customer volume is much higher.

And then we have products that have gotten to enough scale of revenue where they can move the overall number. Obviously, these newer offerings, you invest a lot of time in them, but the early results you're just building that initial customer base. It's relative to the amount of effort, you're not getting as much dollars out as you would with the core business. However, any of the big things start small. And so getting those things seated and started now, I think, is very important, both in terms of what we want the business to do over the course of the next three years, but also in terms of what we want to be in customers like the capabilities we want to provide them, setting ourselves up to really be a strategic platform in these organizations. So yeah, obviously, that's a key effort this year. I would think about the contribution as being throughout next year and kind of a tailwind then."}

{"doc_type": "earnings_call", "ticker": "CFLT", "period": "2023_Q1", "date": "2023-05-03", "section": "prepared", "speaker": "Jay Kreps", "text": "Thanks, Shane. Good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to our first quarter earnings call. I'm pleased to report strong first quarter with results once again exceeding all of our guided metrics. Total revenue grew 38% to $174 million. Confluent Cloud revenue grew 89% to $74 million, and non-GAAP operating margin improved 18 percentage points. These results are a testament to the mission critical nature of our platform, our strong TCO value proposition, and the solid execution of our team despite a volatile macroeconomic environment. Over the last year, Confluent has continued to show very strong gross retention, even through a substantial change in the economic environment, including abrupt changes in interest rates and economic slowdown, significant drop in funding for private tech companies, and the recent challenges in banking. Environments like this show, which products have true durability and which are simply fads are nice to have. I wanted to take the opportunity to explore what drives this durability for Confluent. The first factor is that Confluent serves mission critical custom software applications. These are high value projects that customers invest their expensive software engineering resources in. Because of this high investment, the applications tend to target the most valuable use cases, and last a long time. We often hear from customers about applications lasting not just years, but decades. Naturally, the underlying data platforms used by these applications tend to persist along with them. The second factor is that unlike a database, Confluent isn't just a platform for one app, but acts as an interchange between multiple teams and applications. This is inherent in the core use case of the technology, publishing streams of data, so multiple other applications and teams can consume those streams. This kind of multi-team, multi-application platform gets more and more sticky as it gets more heavily used and displays very different dynamics than the platform that each application can choose or abandon independently. The reason for this is very obvious. The migration to another platform would require a coordinated effort across many teams all at once, which becomes harder and harder to imagine as there are more and more producers and consumers building against the streams of data in the platform. By analogy, think of the cost of switching to a new incompatible telephone system. The challenge isn't buying a new phone, it's getting all your friends to do the same thing at the same time, so you can still call them. This pattern of cross team interaction and cross application interaction is a unique and positive characteristic of data streaming and isn't shared by most other data systems. The third factor of our durability comes from the inherent TCO advantage of our cloud offering. I'm going to dive into this factor at length as it's critical to understanding the deep technical mode that Confluent is built. Initially, it might seem that a customer when faced with budgetary pressure, would want to migrate off the cloud data service back to open source. Open source after all is free. Why isn't this happening? It is no doubt in part due to the comprehensive features and functionality our platform offers. We've talked about this at length in prior earnings calls, but you would imagine the customers might choose to forego better functionality when faced with severe budget pressure. Why isn't this happening? The answer to this may be somewhat counterintuitive. A cloud data service has the opportunity to not just be better than an open source offering, but also be meaningfully cheaper. To understand this, it's important to understand what drives the cost structure of self-managed data systems. This is an analysis we do frequently since we offer both a self-managed software offering and a cloud service. We've worked with thousands of customers both on-premise and in the cloud to analyze and compare the cost structure of open source, self-managed software, and a fully managed cloud service. I'll walk through this analysis and show where our substantial TCO advantage comes from. There are two easily quantifiable areas of spend around a self-managed software system. The first is the cloud infrastructure for running Kafka. This spans compute, storage, networking, and any additional tooling needed to keep Kafka up and running smoothly. These costs tend to increase rapidly, eventually representing the largest portion of cost when usage is at scale. The second is the software engineers and operations people responsible for configuring, deploying and managing Kafka. Like any data system, and particularly like any large scale distributed data system, Kafka requires full-time staff to manage it, and the cost of these individuals is significant, particularly for people managing Kafka. A 2022 study from Dice.com listed Kafka as the fifth highest paying technical skill that's great for engineers doing Kafka DevOps, but not so great for companies hiring teams with the experience to operate Kafka as a production data system. These costs will scale up with the usage of the system. The larger tech companies that have built significant streaming platforms around open source Kafka have teams of 20 or more engineers attending to their data streaming platform. It's not inevitable that a cloud service will improve on these costs. After all, if we were running the same open source software and operating in the same way, our costs would be no different from theirs. However, Confluent has rethought the problem from the ground up and has built a deeply differentiated stack that's able to drive compelling savings in both of these areas. I'll start with infrastructure savings. Confluent Cloud has rethought and re-implemented the core protocols for data streaming in a way that is built natively for the cloud to drive significant savings. I'll enumerate a few of these. First, multi-tenancy. Multi-tenancy is the key to SaaS margins, but many investors don't realize that the majority of data systems in the cloud, especially services offered by the cloud providers around open source, aren't actually capable of multi-tenant operations. Our offering runs multi-tenant for the vast majority of customers. This is a very significant re architecture touching virtually every tier of the stack, allowing us to pool our thousands of customers on shared infrastructure to drive higher utilization and a serverless experience. Next is elasticity. Our intelligent tiering of data between memory, local storage and object storage helps manage the cost of stored data and allows instant scalability, enabling higher utilization of compute resources. Next is our facilities for sophisticated data balancing. Confluent uses the real-time performance data of our customer base to intelligently optimize the placement of data and the routing of traffic to maximize performance, utilization and cost. Finally, networking and data replication. Confluent has optimized the replication of data and the networking stack routing data to drive the cost of networking, the most expensive aspect of cloud operations for streaming. In addition to this, at scale discounts targeting our unique workload help reduce spend. Confluent is now at a larger scale than most of our customers, and we are able to drive discounts targeted to our workload. These significant architectural advantages combined with thousands of small continual optimizations in every layer of the stack help drive our significant cost advantage in operations. Those who have watched our gross margins progress over the last few years have observed this continual progress at work as we've continually driven additional technical improvements and improved utilization from multi-tenant operations as cloud has become a bigger and bigger portion of our revenue base. Next, I want to discuss the advantage that comes from our innovations in at scale operations. Confluent operates our fleet with a set of tools and practices vastly different from our customers. First, our infrastructure improvements do double duty here. The improvements I outlined previously drive vastly higher utilization, and hence we manage an order of magnitude fewer servers than we otherwise would. But the big difference in our operations is that it is done by software, not people. We orchestrate rollouts with a sophisticated feedback driven system that allows safe rollouts across thousands of machines in hours. We are able to automatically detect and remediate the kinds of rare problems that become common at scale, and we have real-time monitoring and checks for every aspect of the integrity of the system. These capabilities provide us with a dramatic advantage in the cost of human management. For example, in our Kafka service, the centerpiece of our offering, Confluent has less than five Kafka engineers on call for our tens of thousands of production Kafka clusters. This gives us a cost structure for operations that we believe is over a thousand times better than our customers. The combination of these savings across infrastructure and operations allows us to offer our service at a price point that makes our product not just better, but also cheaper. We think that's a winning combination, especially in times like these. We've gone to great lengths to ensure we are TCO positive across the customer journey from their first use case to large scale central nervous system. We believe this TCO advantage is not just a factor in driving retention. It will also help us drive far greater monetization of the user base of open source Kafka. This is a point often missed by investors looking to make analogies from on-premise open source models to the cloud, which in fact are quite different. Traditional on-premise open source business models offer a premium product better features for more money. As a result, they typically are able to capture only a fraction of the open source users as paying customers. A cloud product, however, isn't just replacing the free software. It's also replacing the expensive infrastructure and people costs. This is driving a general mindset shift among software engineers and IT departments who are increasingly looking for managed services first, trying to avoid ongoing operations wherever possible. As this shift takes place, we think there is an opportunity to grow from our modest penetration into the hundreds of thousands of open source Kafka users to a much more complete coverage. This higher conversion rate is already apparent. Despite being a much newer offering, and despite the much higher bar of maturity for a cloud service today, Confluent Cloud is already used by more than six times as many customers as Confluent Platform, our self-managed software offering. In fact, we are so confident in this value proposition that we invite prospects to come and take an assessment where we jointly do analysis with them to prove to them that choosing Confluent will be a more economical decision than self-supporting open source Kafka in the room. A great example of the TCO benefits of Confluent for a customer in the earlier stages of the customer journey is a SaaS based billing startup that helps companies scale their consumption, subscription and hybrid pricing models. This customer's data and billing platform is built on Kafka to compute usage and invoices in real-time for millions of end customers and is scaling rapidly to accommodate expected growth, but they quickly found that managing open source Kafka was costly and diverted expensive engineering talent from innovation to low level infrastructure management. With Confluent Cloud, they're able to reallocate at least 60% of their engineers' time managing Kafka to delivering new product innovation without over provisioning infrastructure. As a result, they've reduced deployment times from months to weeks while reducing the total cost of managing open source Kafka. On the other end of the spectrum is a large Q1 deal with the top 10 U.S. bank. Confluent powers thousands of this customers' applications across hundreds of teams spanning digital fraud, payments, analytics, and more. The bank is now going all in on the cloud, undertaking a massive cloud migration to operate more efficiently and introduce new innovation to their customers faster. To accelerate their cloud migration, they closed a seven figure confluent cloud deal to connect their data from on-premise environments to the cloud. Despite the turmoil in the banking industry, this customer accelerated their cloud transformation with Confluent, another example of the many use cases that make data streaming a critical tool for modern organizations, even amid macro uncertainty. We are very excited about the opportunity for similar expansion in other customers as the financial services sector moves to the cloud. In closing, the significant product and cost advantages of our platform put us in a strong position to tap into the hundreds of thousands of users of Kafka with a product that is more than 10 times better and meaningfully cheaper than open source. These dynamics put us in the enviable position as the leader of a $60 billion market opportunity. I look forward to seeing many of you at our Investor Day, where among other things we'll dive deeper into the significant product innovation driving the success of our platform. With that, I'll turn the call over to Steffan to walk through the financials."}

We kicked off fiscal year 2023 beating our guided metrics, delivering high revenue growth, and strong margin improvements in the first quarter. These results demonstrate another quarter of consistent execution from our team in a tougher economic environment. Turning to the results, RPO for the first quarter was $742.6 million, up 35%. Current RPO estimated to be 64% of RPO was $477 million, up 44% and accelerated from last quarter. Growth in RPO, while healthy, was impacted by a decline in average contract duration, additional budget scrutiny, which elongated our deal cycle in a tough comp against the eight figure TCV deal closed a year ago. Moving on to NRR starting this fiscal year, we moved to consumption-based NRR for Confluent Cloud, which provides better alignment and insight to the underlying consumption trends of our cloud business. Total NRR for Q1 was above 130%, and gross retention was above 90%. NRR for both cloud and hybrid customers remained higher than the company average, and NRR for cloud was the highest. We added 160 net new customers ending the quarter with approximately 4,690 total customers up 14%. The growth in our large customer base continued to be robust driven by use case expansion. We added 60 customers with 100 K or more in ARR, bringing the total to 1075 customers, up 34%. These large customers contributed more than 85% of total revenue in the quarter. We also added eight customers with $1 million or more in ARR, bringing the total to 135 customers, up 53%. We've included historical results for NRR and customer count relating to the ARR methodology change in our IR presentation on our website. Turning to the P&L, total revenue grew 38% to $174.3 million. Subscription revenue grew 41% to $160.6 million, and accounted for 92% of total revenue. Within subscription Confluent Platform revenue grew 16% to $86.9 million and accounted for 50% of total revenue. Confluent Platform outperformed relative to our expectations and was driven by a strong performance in the public sector vertical. Confluent Cloud exceeded 50% of total new ACV bookings for the sixth consecutive quarter. Cloud revenue grew 89% to $73.6 million, representing a sequential increase of $5.3 million exceeding our guidance. Cloud accounted for 42% of total revenue compared to 41% last quarter. The modest increase in cloud revenue mix relative to historical trends was due to the outperformance in Confluent Platform in the quarter. Turning to the geographic mix of revenue, revenue from the U.S. grew 32% to $103.9 million. Revenue from outside the U.S. grew 49% to $70.4 million. Moving on to the rest of the income statement, I'll be referring to non-GAAP results unless stated otherwise. Total gross margin was 72.2%, up 250 basis points and modestly above our target range of 70% to 72%. Subscription gross margin was 77.5%, up 200 basis points. Our healthy gross margins were driven by the continued improvement in the unit economics and scaling of our cloud offering, offset by a continued revenue mix shift to cloud. Turning to profitability and cash flow. Operating margin improved 18 percentage points to negative 23.1%, representing our third consecutive quarter of more than 10 points in improvement. Q1 operating margin was driven by our revenue outperformance, which we let flow through to the bottom line, and our continued focus on driving efficiency across the company. We drove improvement in every category of our operating expenses with the most pronounced progress made again in sales and marketing, improving 11 percentage points. Net loss per share was negative $0.09 using 291.9 million basic and diluted weighted average shares outstanding. Fully diluted share count under the treasury stock method was approximately 350.1 million."}

The demand environment for data streaming and the solutions we're offering to the market continues to be robust even in a choppy macro environment where it's taking longer to close deals. Mid last year, we were early to flag the increase in the volatility of the business environment and incorporate those dynamics into our outlook. Looking out to Q2 and the balance of the year, we're expecting to deliver on the commitments we outlined on our last call. We are assuming there's a continuation of additional budget scrutiny and there'll be no improvement in the business environment through the remainder of this year. We'll continue to proactively allocate capital to drive efficient growth and are managing the rate and pace of investments. For the second quarter of 2023 we expect revenue to be in the range of $181 million to $183 million, representing growth of 30% to 31%. Cloud sequential revenue add to be in the range of $7.5 million to $8 million. We continue to expect cloud sequential revenue add to increase every quarter for the rest of 2023. Non-GAAP operating margin to be approximately negative 16% and non-GAAP net loss per share to be in the range of negative $0.08 to negative $0.06 using approximately $297 million weighted average shares outstanding. For the full year 2023 we expect revenue to be in the range of $760 million to $765 million, representing growth of 30% to 31%, non-GAAP operating margin to be approximately negative 14% to negative 13% and non-GAAP net loss per share in the range of negative $0.20 to negative $0.14 using approximately 300 million weighted average shares outstanding. Additionally, for Q4 23, we expect to deliver 48% to 50% of total revenue from cloud and achieve breakeven for non-GAAP operating margin. The timing for free cash flow breakeven will roughly mirror that of our operating margin. In closing, I'm pleased with the strong start to fiscal year 2023. While the macroeconomic environment remains challenging, we're continuing to deliver innovation and value to our customers, which would not be possible without the excellent performance of the members of our team. Looking forward, we remain focused on driving efficient growth and building a profitable business. Now, Jay and I will take your questions."}

It makes a lot of sense and encouraging to hear about the trends post March on the consumption side of financial services. Jay, you did a fantastic job of sort of explaining the value proposition of Confluent Cloud and the TCO advantages that Confluent is bringing to bear to the market. I guess the other side of the coin, in terms of what we're, what we're trying to better understand is the impact of generative AI. And if you're thinking about the classes of applications and the interfaces of those applications, what do you think is the impact on real-time streaming? Is that a force accelerator for the category in terms of the apps or is that a potential headwind?"}

I mean, it's early in terms of production deployments as you would expect, but already we have customers that are doing this for real, including a large travel company that's building real-time context data and using that to power chat interfaces for their customers and I expect that to be a pattern that is more common. Generally speaking, when there's a new major area that data may need to go towards, that's a powerful thing for Confluent. The more new things, the better for us. And so I know in some areas it's actually a bit of a disruptive force, but for us, this is actually a powerful thing. And then our role in that architecture is kind of helping customers assemble that real-time context data that would go into asking the right questions, powering the right queries, getting the right context into the interface, that's where we fit into that architecture. And then of course the same as any enterprise company, there's a lot of interesting use cases internally. We have a number of organizations, whether that's support, engineering, legal, where there's a significant amount of work that is basically text in and text out that all of those teams could potentially be made more productive, kind of up their game as a result, as some of these tools come into practice."}

Prior to making the change, we had a commit based NRR calculation, which didn't really capture the underlying momentum of our cloud business. With the consumption change to the NRR calculation, we're now capturing really the consumption-based strength of our business. It's better reflective of the actual underlying growth drivers, and it's also very consistent with what our peer group companies are doing that have a consumption-based model. So think of MongoDB, Datadog, Snowflake, they all have moved to a consumption-based NRR. So where it shows up is in our cloud business and then also in our hybrid customer NRR cohort, because those hybrid customers are running both Confluent Platform and Confluent Cloud. Confluent Platform will continue to be on the, like the older methodology, which is the committed contract basis, but for the portion of their business that is Confluent Cloud, we'll calculate it using the commit basis. So then as far as the older methodology, we did come in just slightly below the 125% metric that we established as a goal for total NRR. And what we saw, the underlying drivers, the gross retention of our business continues to be very strong above 90%, but considering the current macro environment we just saw less expansion driving, that was driving through like the committed contract part of the business. But what we did see and what's better reflective in the new methodology is the consumption patterns of our customers are exceeding the committed contract spend. And so those were -- those are some of the dynamics at play and going forward where we will be reporting a consumption based NRR metric, and that is, again, better reflective of the underlying performance of the business."}

Thank you guys for taking my question, good afternoon. Steffan, I know you just spoke to it to some degree, but you called out gross retention rates and you've said they are above 90%. Can you walk us back a couple of years, the last time we saw disruption around COVID and talk about what the experience with retention was then versus now? And is this becoming a much stickier application at this point?"}

A couple of years ago, the product that we had in the marketplace, while it was good, it didn't necessarily have all of the matured feature of functionality that we do today. The amount of innovation, our product and development organization has driven over the last couple of years, there's a marked difference between our product today versus what it was two years ago. And so a couple of years ago, the gross retention rates were lower. The net retention rates were lower. Now we have really healthy net retention rates and gross retention rates due to the product maturity. And then also, if you layer into the equation the improvements we've made to our go-to-market organization, we have this customer growth go-to-market journey that we've socialized with the investment community. And how we land customers is very important and then how we develop them over time through the progression that they start with from PayGo, all the way up through a fully mature implementation of our solution. It just has become much more sticky. And because we're an infrastructure play, this is not something that can be easily ripped and replaced or downgraded to the open source version. There's a vast difference between our Confluent Cloud offering and anything that you could get in open source and therein lies the big differential."}

And I wanted to talk about, there's a lot of Kafka DIY out there, ranging from very large cluster deployments from tens of thousands of companies in the long tail and obviously, you guys have some really compelling TCO and ROI figures. Is the macro tipping point to drive more conversion? And when you look at kind of the top end of the pyramid and the bottom end, are you focused on one end or the other more in this environment to drive more open source conversions?"}
{"doc_type": "earnings_call", "ticker": "CFLT", "period": "2023_Q1", "date": "2023-05-03", "section": "qa", "speaker": "Jay Kreps", "text": "Yes, I think it is ultimately helpful. The initial impact of some downturn is not helpful, right? Customers are reprioritizing, people are being laid off, things are changing, that's not a helpful environment to do business in. And the additional scrutiny that we've talked about is exactly the factor. Over time, I do think that there's a mindset shift that's happening in technology where, to some extent, the more tech-forward organizations were kind of copying Google model from some decade ago where you would build out these internal infrastructure platforms in-house and staff them up, and that was going to be a kind of lever for success. And I think the modern way is just to get a managed service, and that, that's ultimately better and more cost effective. And I think that, that mindset shift is really important and is an important tailwind for us. So when I talked about that, hey, what is the penetration that's possible for a company into the open source user base? I think that's ultimately the big driver, right? It's both about us having good enough cost structure, having that TCO, making that true. It's not inherently true of every cloud product, right? That's something we've done a ton of work to make true. And then it's about people really kind of internalizing that and understanding it and acting on it, which doesn't happen immediately, but it is happening now. And so yes, when you talk about where on the journey are we focused? We do look at that full journey, right? For us, because customers progress, you start with one use case. It spreads to broader in the organization and becomes a big platform. It doesn't make sense to start at only one place. If you did that, maybe you might focus at the beginning of the journey, but customers would -- as they got to large scale, you wouldn't have the features and functionality to really support them. They would migrate off, right? That wouldn't be good. Only focusing on the very largest customers and not getting the next 100,000 Kafka users who are just starting now, that wouldn't make sense either, right? It makes most sense to start with them as they go. So the reality is, both in terms of the TCO and the customer experience, you have to be good all along the way. That's why it's actually so hard for these cloud products. It's why it's not a trivial thing to do. You have to be very easy to use and a better deal for that first app, 1 developer kicking the tires. And you have to be something that can be deployed at scale and used across a large organization effectively and has the right controls and governance of data, et cetera, as you get to scale. I think that's why it's a deep area of investment to really do this well. And that's the journey we've been on. And I think the cool thing about where we're at with our cloud product right now is we have substantial customer usage at each spot along that. And indeed, we're kind of going out to the open source users and converting them over to this now, whatever stage on that journey they happen to be on right now."}

Yes, that's an industry that obviously, a lot is happening in. And so the willingness to make big bets on this in the cloud, right? These are organizations that are very sensitive about security, about compliance, et cetera, really do a thorough job of betting. The willingness to make a big bet in this area is really one of a small number of third-party cloud infrastructure of vendors. I think that speaks to how critical this area is. And you could probably come up with a similar example in any other industry of interest, whether that's retail, insurance, automotive, public sector, really exciting things happening in each of those."}

Your investment priorities in particular, I guess, with respect to hiring more reps, bolstering customer retention efforts, building out -- further building out the channel ecosystem? And do -- has anything changed in the last few months that would require you to invest more in any of these fronts that would, I guess, derail or impede the plans to reach breakeven exiting year-end?"}

And a lot of that is based off of \"capacity\" that we want to ensure that we have across the world. And we will continue to be hiring in areas that show the most promise and that have the most potential ROI for us. We will continue to make investments in our customer success organization, ensuring that the experience for the customer continues to be excellent, that will both bolster our gross retention rates. Nothing has changed relative to our major investment priorities for the year. In fact, I've been very pleased with the performance of how the groups are operating in a very choppy environment. If you look at the growth in RPO -- if you look at the growth at in CRPO in particular, we had an acceleration in CRPO this quarter. And that's in part due to the great work that the sales organization and the go-to-market organization is doing. So to answer your question, no real changes relative to our plans that we outlined at the beginning of the year. And as I said in my prepared remarks, we're on track to achieve breakeven in Q4."}

There's -- obviously, there's a big discussion going on with cloud consumption, optimization, et cetera, and we talked about it a little bit. Jay, like in what respect are you guys part of that? Can people kind of buy you through the marketplace now, and that's kind of a little bit of a headwind or is it more like people not doing -- now like there's a finite number of new projects starting in this environment and then so, that's kind of more what's kind of creating the headwind for you?"}

If you think about it, like you obviously outperformed Q1, well done, you've cut the full year guidance. That kind of is either more uncertainty or there's more of a buffer in the year. Could you just talk a little bit about the puts and takes that took your kind of guidance for the full year? Thank you."}
{"doc_type": "earnings_call", "ticker": "CFLT", "period": "2023_Q1", "date": "2023-05-03", "section": "qa", "speaker": "Jay Kreps", "text": "Yes. I'll start with the first question. I think it's ultimately like, hey, to what extent are we subject to optimization, cloud optimization, which is a topic in every user of the public cloud, including us. And to what extent are we impacted by potentially fewer net new software projects that are occurring? Yes, I would say the latter is probably the most significant factor, right? So our expansion is driven by new projects coming on, adding their data streams, using the technology, taking it out to new use cases. The rate of that is certainly an important variable for us in growth. In addition to how active we are at converting those use cases, which is about the TCO in comparison to open source, et cetera, right? So those two variables are very important. Is it possible to optimize the usage of Confluent? Yes, of course, right. It's possible to optimize the use of any SaaS product, right? And this shows up quicker in products that have a consumption revenue model. It shows up that very quarter. But obviously, companies are going through and cutting seats and looking at who really needs the access to that tool and of course, all the layoffs and any other trimming of staff slow down to seat-based models, doing exactly the same way. So yes, I think there's optimization happening everywhere, you just see it faster in the consumption models. Within those products, of course, it's wildly different how much optimization is possible. And that has everything to do with what the product actually does, right? How much do you actually need, the thing that you bought? Is it, in fact, a mission-critical thing that you're going to keep running or is it something where you can just turn off if you don't need it? And that's an area where I think we have it very good. We're a mission-critical part of the production application stack. Those applications typically come fairly well optimized. Of course, you can go rewrite your applications to try to be more efficient, send less data, whatever. But that's a lot of work, and it usually has already been done in the kind of building and deployment process. And so we certainly see that, but we don't see as much of it. And so typically, as we have kind of consumption coming online, it's kind of mostly pre-optimized. There may be further optimizations that will happen. But of course, that all folds up into that overall net retention rate and we haven't seen any big changes in that in the last few quarters. Customers, of course, are trying to optimize, but they're also adding new projects, which drives expansion, what you see as kind of the combination of those two factors, which I think, in the end is quite strong."}

The demand environment remains healthy, even though it's a tough macro out there. So we're reaffirming our guide for the full year, growing revenue at 30% and plan to achieve breakeven on a non-GAAP operating margin basis in Q4. We did not flow through the amount of the over-performance we had in the top line this quarter to the full year guide, which is really a byproduct of the macro environment and factors I've called out before, which we're trying to prudently take into consideration while formulating guidance. You asked for some puts and takes. We expect cloud to continue its growth momentum with the highest NRR and an increase in sequential revenue add every quarter for the remainder of the year. And then the CRPO growth that I pointed out before, it continues to be robust. NRR remained healthy. And both of those things support the growth and the overall business plan."}

I guess, first for Jay. At your Investor briefing last October, I think it was Eric who mentioned that on average, you were taking customers who made a significant commit, about six months, for their annualized consumption to match their commitment levels. Obviously, the macro has gotten tougher since then. So I was just curious kind of where that stands today."}

That's more determined by how long it takes them to build their applications, get them online, get them fully consuming, roll them out, which is the average of companies who are moving very fast and companies who move slower. So I'd say that has less impact from the macro. We have seen a little bit of change in the behavior of customers and how they use the commits. Steffan called out a little bit of compression in the multiyear stuff. In general, I think customers are just being thoughtful about the amount that they're committing to. And the plus side of that is we've seen very strong consumption against those committed amounts, which is great. That's what we want to see. We don't want customers buying a lot that remains unused or anything like that. And so that kind of above-100% utilization is a good thing."}

We've been watching it closely because I think that segment obviously has a lot of these private tech companies that I think are a bit fragile under very significant pressure. And so we kind of have expected to see some hit there, and have not. I would describe that primarily to the fact that there's just a lot of untapped opportunity. So of course, there is pressure. Of course, that is a countervailing force, but there's also just a lot of open source kind of usage to grow into. And so the fact that we hadn't paid as much attention to that segment until later at the life of the company and have now gone after it means there's still a lot of opportunity there."}

So Steffan, just on the cloud revenue side, I think you altered your guidance a little bit to 48% to 50% of Confluent Cloud -- of revenue coming from Confluent Cloud in 4Q. Just curious if that's more so a function of new use cases being brought online being a little bit slower than you expected? Or is it growth of existing use cases moderating a little bit?"}

And then as we think about just the mix of business, we did have a strong Q1 for Confluent Platform. And we look at the overall mix for the year. And so we modestly shaped the guide for our cloud business. Originally, we said approximately 50% for the year. We basically gave a range, widened it a little bit to 48% to 50%. I will say that given the run rate that we have with Confluent Cloud, where we're almost at a $300 million run rate, growing at 89%. And the consumption of Confluent Cloud continues to be robust. So when we think about use case expansion opportunities, there is a natural network effect with the consumption business that we're seeing. In this environment, sometimes it does take companies longer to deploy new workloads, et cetera. So that was factored into the 48% to 50% comment that I made earlier."}

And of course, to the extent that software engineers can become more productive in building applications around this, through tools like copilot and things like that. Obviously, we become more efficient building our products, but also our customers actually can be much faster at consuming our products and that's a phenomenal thing. We'll have to see how it all plays out.

Two years ago, it accounted for 18% of revenue. And today, it accounts for 42% of revenue. And it comes at a lower gross margin profile than Platform. And we've made a lot of progress on the unit economic -- unit economics there. And we've seen really, really strong growth. So as we look towards what the future holds, we feel comfortable with the 70% to 72% range, because we think the cloud business will continue its upward trajectory. Longer term, we think it will be in the -- call it the mid-70s. The rate and pace of us being able to expand there is going to be dependent upon a lot of the engineering work that we're doing, the price discipline that we have and the value that we're bringing to our customers. And then as it relates to how our overall guidance worked for not only Q2, but for the balance of the year, we are anticipating being at the higher end of our near-term range of 70% to 72% in gross margin. We're definitely letting that flow through the bottom line, but we're also seeing the efficiency work that we've been really focused on across all OpEx line items paying off. And so our operational cadence around efficient growth is playing out. We have -- that work is never done. And we're laser-focused on delivering it. But we're very happy that we're able to deliver top line revenue growth that is in what we call high-growth mode and dramatically improve operating margin on our path to get to breakeven in Q4."}

And then was there anything in particular that drove the Platform strength in the quarter? I know it's certainly by two things. I mean, one, most of the revenue upside came from the Platform versus your guide. And then secondly, I know in Q4, cloud was 70% -- over 70% of new bookings, and it was over 50% this quarter. So obviously, the new bookings mix trend in more terms Platform. Anything in particular that you think drove that strength?"}

And it was actually the best Q1 in public sector that the company has ever had. So that really drove the strength in the Platform over-performance. And because of that strength, we did see a mix shift from an ACV standpoint. While cloud was greater than 50%, it did come down from a mix standpoint given just the strength in Confluent Platform. I will say that Confluent Cloud, we've had now six-plus quarters in a row of greater than 50% of net new ACV being Confluent Cloud. So that businesses still continues to grow at a very rapid pace. It was just that Confluent Platform deals tend to be lumpy, and they can be seasonal also, and that's what we saw play out this quarter."}

{"doc_type": "earnings_call", "ticker": "CFLT", "period": "2024_Q4", "date": "2025-02-11", "section": "prepared", "speaker": "Jay Kreps", "text": "Thanks, Shane. Good afternoon everyone and welcome to our fourth quarter earnings call. I'm happy to report we exceeded all guided metrics. Subscription revenue grew 24% to $251 million. Confluent Cloud revenue grew 38% to $138 million and non-GAAP operating margin was 5% our third consecutive positive quarter. These results highlight our customers need for a complete data streaming platform, our world class innovation engine and our successful transformation to a consumption driven go-to-market model. I'm also thrilled to announce a major expansion of our strategic partnership with Databricks. This collaboration brings together Confluent's complete data streaming platform and Databricks Data Intelligence platform to empower enterprises with real time data for AI driven decision making. The bidirectional integration between Confluence Tableflow with Delta Lake and Databricks Unity Catalog will provide consistent real time data across operational and analytical systems that is discoverable, secure and trustworthy. Built on open standards, these integrations ensure real time interoperability and flexibility across diverse ecosystems. Seamlessly working with the tools and data infrastructure that companies already use. Operational data from Confluent becomes a first class citizen in Databricks and the insights created within Databricks can be driven back into any processor in the enterprise via Tableflow and Confluent. This is an incredibly exciting prospect for companies worldwide. This partnership extends Tableflow's reach across the analytics ecosystem, positioning Confluent as the leading vendor for delivering data across the enterprise. This is crucial for scaling AI innovation by giving application developers, data engineers, data analysts and data scientists a single real time source of truth to power advanced analytics and Next-Gen AI driven applications. Additionally, our partnership with Databricks includes comprehensive go-to-market efforts encompassing field and partner enablement solutions, architectures, co-marketing and co-selling initiatives. Together we will enable businesses to harness the power of real time data to build sophisticated AI driven applications for their most critical use cases. Tableflow continues to be one of the most exciting and powerful additions to our data streaming platform. Tableflow exposes Confluent's data streams as continuously updating tables in cloud object storage using open standards like Apache Iceberg and now Delta Lake. This allows Confluent to act as the bridge between operational systems that run the business and analytical platforms like Athena, BigQuery Databricks and Snowflake that extract valuable insights. Historically, operational and analytical systems operated in separate silos managed by different teams and composed of different technologies and workflows. To compensate, teams built point to point batch oriented pipelines to move operational data to the analytical estate, resulting in insights based on outdated and incomplete data. In the era of real time data and AI, scale data simply isn't enough for modern businesses. Data streaming has emerged as a major data platform, putting Confluent in a unique position to replace the brittle connections between operations and analytics with something that is much more robust and much more scalable. In fact, our mission and business model is built on creating continuous, trustworthy and discoverable streams of data that can be consumed anywhere in the organization. Tableflow further realizes our mission by making real time, consistent and secure data available as structured tables in cloud object storage using an open table format. With Tableflow, data is defined and stored once but accessible across multiple processors, breaking down silos and enabling faster, more accurate insights. Tableflow was met with excitement across our customer base and is already delivering real benefits to early customers. Take a U.S. digital native customer that simplifies bookings and operations for ground transportation companies across three continents as an example. Their customers require real time data for a seamless online booking experience with accurate pricing and precise arrival and drop off times. Previously, they did this by loading data into Snowflake with batch jobs for analytics. However, this caused delays and increased data processing costs. So the digital native customer implemented Tableflow as part of our early access program to bridge their operational data with their analytics systems. Using Apache Iceberg with Tableflow, Confluent Cloud automatically performs the required data preprocessing and ingested into Snowflake as high quality data. The customer can now derive business insights directly from the data faster and at a much lower cost, significantly speeding up analysis and decision making for its transportation customers. Tableflow is also a great example of what we discussed last quarter. Our third wave of growth will come from being a complete data streaming platform. Over the last year, we continue to see strong DSP momentum in our Cloud Connect process and govern accounted for approximately 13% of our cloud business with consumption growing substantially faster than overall cloud. No other vendor is as intensely focused as us on building and delivering a complete data streaming platform that connects, streams, processes and governs data continuously in motion. This puts Confluent in a highly advantageous position because over time, as more parts of our platform are used, a virtuous cycle of adoption drives stickiness and more growth. Above all else, we believe a complete data streaming platform solves our customer’s hardest problems, reduces complexity and provides substantial ROI. Let me walk through a few customer examples. Zazzle [ph] is a global online marketplace and platform for creating and customizing unique designs. The company is built on a foundation of technological innovation that connects customers, creators and makers powering the creation of almost anything. As a leading global marketplace, Zazzle [ph] needs to efficiently process massive amounts of clickstream data to deliver personalized experiences across its unparalleled range of products and designs. With hundreds of thousands of independent creators making a living through the Zazzle [ph] platform and customers in every country worldwide, maintaining platform performance while eliminating redundant data became critical. So Zazzle [ph] implemented Confluent's fully managed Flink offering to transform their largest data pipeline. By shifting stream processing earlier in the pipeline before writing to Google BigQuery, Zazzle [ph] reduced storage and computation costs while delivering more relevant product recommendations directly impacting revenue. But this is just the start. With this foundation in place, Zazzle [ph] plans to expand their Flink usage to additional data streams to further enhance real time personalization capabilities. A leading European grocery delivery service has also built its data architecture on Confluent's data streaming platform and leverages our Apache Flink offering to optimize real time order management. This digital first company manages the entire grocery delivery process, overseeing daily inventory updates for thousands of products across local warehouses. To meet their ambitious promise of delivery within 20 minutes, they require a robust real time stream processing solution to monitor and manage orders end to end from warehouse to driver to customer. Previously, their reliance on REST API calls and event driven architectures using open source Kafka led to inefficiencies, delays and fragmented data sources. By transitioning to Confluent Cloud with Apache Flink, they now seamlessly process key data streams, including grocery orders and warehouse locations into a unified order topic that is easy to manage and Consume. Flink further enables them to aggregate orders, assign them to delivery drivers and track driver speed and location to provide accurate delivery time estimates for customers. This streamlined solution has significantly enhanced their order management capabilities, resulting in reduced development costs, minimized downtime and a faster, more seamless experience for both drivers and customers. A top three Fortune Global 100 telecom customer shows the value of a complete DSP as consumers make calls, send texts and access the Internet, a constant flow of data from mobile devices is sent to cell towers across the network. This data then needs to be shared with partners and subsidiaries in real time so they can optimize network coverage and analyze customer usage patterns. The telco's previous legacy streaming service was unable to deliver the scale and speed required for the mission critical cell tower workloads, so they turned to Confluence Complete DSP for real time visibility and improved scalability across their wireless network. With Confluent's data streaming platform, the telecom provider streams mobile data from 70,000 U.S. cell towers with connectors feeding data into lakes and warehouses. Stream processing provides real time insights into network reliability and performance of mobile devices and wireless plants, which is then shared with partners and subsidiaries. This allows the telecom provider to unlock new revenue streams by making faster, smarter decisions ranging from where to invest in 5G capabilities to where to lay down fiber optic cables. Citizens bank, one of America's oldest and largest financial institutions, transitioned from open source Kafka to Confluent DSP to strengthen its digital banking offerings. Today's banking customers expect real time experiences like immediate fraud alerts and instant access to deposited funds. But with an expanding data footprint, Citizens struggled self managing open source Kafka, which required 20 full time employees just to support, so they turned to Confluent's complete data streaming platform. Using Confluent Cloud, Citizens Bank connects data from sources like consumer checking account, credit cards and FICO fraud scores, generating real time actionable insights. Stream governance ensures the bank's data is high quality and trustworthy by using schemas to reduce data inconsistencies and ensure compliance. With Confluent, Citizens Bank has reduced IT costs by 30% and saved $1.2 million annually by reducing fraud false positives by 15%. Additionally, the bank has seen a 20% increase in customer engagement, a 40% faster loan processing time and a 10 point increase in net promoter score from improved customer interactions. And finally, I'd like to close with an update on the innovation and momentum in our Kafka business including wins and early WarpStream success. At Confluent our strategy starts with capturing the vast opportunity presented by Apache Kafka, which serves as the real time backbone for more than 150,000 organizations worldwide. Doing this requires having the right offering to meet the performance, TCO and reliability requirements of an incredibly wide variety of use cases. In 2024 we invested in offerings to better capture the entirety of this market. One area we targeted was the high volume cost sensitive workloads common in observability, analytics, security and IoT. Now generally available freight clusters are a great offering for this segment. They're designed to attract cost conscious customers with high throughput, latency tolerant workloads. We paired this with WarpStream, which serves a similar customer base but allows running directly in the customer's account, adding a low friction midpoint between self-managed and SaaS. We've seen great traction with both of these offerings in helping us penetrate new accounts, particularly in the large scale digital native segment with offerings that address use cases that demand zero access security and have tolerance for relaxed latency. This is playing out already. In fact, every WarpStream deal closed since acquisition was from our digital native cohort, including companies like Elastic, the search AI Company used by over half the Fortune 500 and Cursor, the AI code editor that's become one of the hottest names in AI and the vast majority are net new customers to Confluent. We're excited for the future of WarpStream and continue to invest in its innovation, including a whole host of new features released in January. One expansion with WarpStream this quarter was with a digital native customer that helps developer’s access real time data. Their large scale and high storage requirements made this a significant cost driver. Previously they used Redpanda, but as their usage increased, so did their bill. The unsustainable costs combined with performance issues with Redpanda led to their decision to adopt WarpStream. Switching from Redpanda to WarpStream delivered immediate benefits for the customer, including nearly 10x cost savings and the ability to handle much higher data volumes on their platform. This has unlocked entirely new use cases for the customer that weren't possible before. In closing, we're pleased with our strong performance this year. The progress we made and the innovation we delivered to customers in 2024 set us up to capture more of the significant market opportunity ahead. With that, I'll turn it over to Rohan."}

Good afternoon everyone and thank you for joining our earnings call. We had a strong finish to fiscal year 2024, delivering durable growth, significant operating leverage and positive free cash flow. In fiscal year 2024, subscription revenue grew 26% to $922.1 million, non-GAAP operating margin improved 10 percentage points to 2.9% and free cash flow margin improved 17 percentage points to 1%, making fiscal year 2024 our first non-GAAP profitable year in the company's history. These results well exceeded our initial expectations across all guided metrics entering the year, reflecting the power of our data streaming platform and our team's excellent execution against our large market opportunity. Turning to the Q4 results, subscription revenue grew 24% to $250.6 million, exceeding the high end of our guidance and representing 96% of total revenue. Confluent platform revenue grew 10% to $112.7 million and accounted for 45% of subscription revenue. Demand for enterprise grade data streaming in regulated industries remain a key growth driver for Confluent Platform. Confluent Cloud revenue grew 38% to $137.9 million and accounted for 55% of subscription revenue compared to 49% a year ago. During the quarter, we saw stable consumption and continued use case expansion across our large customer base, driving robust growth in our core streaming business. Additionally, we saw continued adoption of new components of our data streaming platform. DSP Cloud consumption which includes connect, process and govern, grew substantially faster than overall cloud and accounted for approximately 13% of our cloud business. Turning to geographical mix of total revenue, revenue from the U.S. grew 20% to $153.7 million. Revenue growth from outside the U.S. accelerated to 26% and was $107.5 million. Earlier today we announced a multiyear strategic partnership with Jio Platforms Ltd, an Indian multinational technology company and a subsidiary of Reliance Industries Limited. By making Confluent Cloud available on Jio Cloud Services and Confluent Platform as a managed service the partnership is expected to accelerate India's development of Gen AI and Next Gen applications, delivering the power of real time data to more businesses in the country. Moving on to rest of the income statement, I'll be referring to non-GAAP results unless stated otherwise. While continuing to drive top line growth at scale, we once again demonstrated significant operating leverage in our model. In Q4 subscription gross margin increased 90 basis points to 82%, primarily driven by the economies of scale in Confluent Cloud. Operating margin was 5.2%, exceeding our guidance of approximately 2% and was primarily driven by revenue and gross margin outperformance. Free cash flow margin expanded approximately 8 percentage points to reach a record high of 11.1%. Net income per share was $0.09 using 362.1 million diluted weighted average shares outstanding. Fully diluted share count under the treasury stock method was approximately 370.1 million. Net income per share was $0.09 using 362.1 million diluted weighted average shares outstanding. Fully diluted share count under the treasury stock method was approximately 370.1 million and our balance sheet remains strong, ending the fourth quarter with $1.91 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. Turning now to other business metrics, Q4 win rate for new business once again saw a notable increase both year-over-year and sequentially. Our win rate against the CSP offerings and smaller startups remained well above 90%. This underscores the strength of our complete data streaming platform, providing outstanding performance with unparalleled reliability and flexibility and favorable TCO and ROI for our customers. This coupled with our consumption transformation has driven a year of high velocity land and expand. We ended fiscal year 2024 with approximately 5,800 customers, representing an increase of 840 customers, nearly double the total increase from the previous year. New customers in the quarter include a top five video gaming company, one of the world's largest sports media outlets, a Fortune 100 pharmaceuticals company, a global cruise operator, a leading European airliner, and many more. We also drove robust expansion in our large customer base. We grew our 100K plus ARR customer count to 1,381, an increase of 12% from a year ago. This represents approximately 24% of our total customers, a key success indicator of our expansion strategy after landing a customer. These 100K plus ARR customers represented approximately 90% of our revenue. Our 1 million plus ARR customers grew even faster, accelerating to 23% and ending the quarter at 194 customers. New 1 million plus ARR customers include customers from a wide variety of industries spanning financial services, healthcare, manufacturing and logistics, retail technology and more. Q4 NRR was 117% while GRR remained above 90%. Our stabilized NRR in recent quarters, coupled with continued strength in GRR provides a solid foundation for delivering on our growth target this year. Before turning to our guidance, I would like to discuss Confluent’s positioning for 2025 and beyond. 2024 was in many ways a consequential year. First, we have optimized our pricing and packaging with the introduction of Enterprise Clusters, Freight Clusters and the acquisition of WarpStream. This has significantly increased our serviceable, addressable market as we are positioned to deliver best-in-class TCO for a broad range of use cases across self-managed, fully managed and BYOC deployment models. Second, we extended our technology lead by expanding our DSP capabilities with more than 200 features and capabilities across Stream Connect, Process and Govern. With the upcoming Tableflow GA release, we will expand our growth vector by unifying the operational and analytical estates in data management. Finally, we have successfully transitioned to the next generation go-to-market model focusing our team on consumption based selling. By increasing consumption of our data streaming platform, we help customers realize substantial ROI for powering their mission critical and real time AI workloads. As we drive ROI based expansions throughout our customers data streaming journey, we expect our growth and profitability profile to strengthen over time. Following a year of substantial transformation, we have established a major data platform for the enterprise, unlocking the power of data streaming for thousands of customers and operating at a $1 billion plus revenue run rate. Given the strong foundation we set last year, we expect to begin reaping the benefits in 2025. Our objective is to continue soaking up the world's Kafka and to establish 2025 as the year of DSP. We will support these initiatives with the resource allocation strategy, focusing on efficient growth and prioritizing our investments in expanding our DSP capabilities, hiring and enabling our team to sell DSP, and forming strategic partnerships and alliances. We look forward to driving durable and efficient growth in 2025 as we execute against our large and growing market opportunity. Now let's turn to our guidance. We are providing Q1 and fiscal year 2025 subscription revenue outlook ahead of expectations. In addition to guiding fiscal year 2025 non-GAAP operating margin within our midterm target set at the time of our IPO. For the first fiscal quarter of 2025, we expect subscription revenue to be in the range of $253 million to $254 million, representing growth of approximately 22% to 23%. Non-GAAP operating margin to be approximately 3% and non-GAAP net income per diluted share to be in the range of $0.06 to $0.07. For fiscal year 2025, we expect subscription revenue to be in the range of $1.117 billion to 1.121 billion, representing growth of approximately 21% to 22%. Non-GAAP operating margin to be approximately 6% and non-GAAP net income per diluted share to be approximately $0.35. I'd also like to provide a few modeling points. For subscription revenue seasonality, at the midpoint of our guidance, we expect the first half of fiscal year 2025 will be approximately 46.5% in line with the average of the first half seasonality in the last two years. For Cloud revenue, we are comfortable with the current consensus dollar estimate for fiscal year 2025 and we expect to see approximately one point of increase in cloud subscription revenue mix each quarter with the Q4 25 exit of approximately 59% to 60%. For free cash flow margin, we expect a one-time negative impact of approximately 15 points to Q1, 2025 or approximately 3 points to 4 points to fiscal year 2025 resulting from a change to timing of cash compensation payments for most of our non-go-to-market employees. Excluding this onetime impact, we expect adjusted free cash flow margin for fiscal year 2025 to be approximately 6%. In closing, our strong finish to 2024 is a testament to our large TAM, the market leadership of our technology platform and our world class team. Powered by the secular tailwinds of cloud, data and AI, we are incredibly excited to take advantage of the market opportunity ahead. Before turning to Q&A, we will host Investor Day 2025 on March 6th in San Francisco. If you are interested in attending in person, please contact the IR team at investors@onfluent io. Now Jay and I will take your questions."}

Congrats team on the results. Really strong end to the year, I guess. Jay, I want to start with you. There was news a couple weeks ago about Snowflake potentially looking at acquiring Redpanda. And today you announced really an excited, expanded relationship with Databricks. I guess I'm wondering, could you talk more at a high level of how customers think about using Confluent for streaming and processing outside of analytic engines and then maybe where that processing makes sense within the data lake or data warehousing layer?"}
{"doc_type": "earnings_call", "ticker": "CFLT", "period": "2024_Q4", "date": "2025-02-11", "section": "qa", "speaker": "Jay Kreps", "text": "Yes, yes, it's a great question. So there's a really two kind of key points that are driving this. One is the rise of these AI applications, which increasingly it's not just like a report that has yesterday's data or kind of a warehouse where people can do ad hoc analysis periodically. This is actually operating as part of the business and so it needs data that's kind of up to speed with what's happening in the business and that's driving the need for real time data in the analytics world. The second is the rise of these open data formats. So Iceberg or Delta, these are a new way of laying out all the data in the analytics realm in kind of open object storage. It may not be obvious, but this table flow offering that we talked about is kind of we think, the best way to get this. So it's a real time feed of all the data that's available in the streaming world that's then projected out as Iceberg or Delta tables. And so we talk about the partnership with Databricks. It's both integration into Delta their format and unity their catalog, which opens up anything in Confluent for use in the Databricks ecosystem, including those types of applications. And then going along with that is go-to-market activities to take that out to customers. And back to the question of hey, where is this useful to customers? There's a very clear ecosystem of analytics use cases applications. There's a very clear ecosystem of operational kind of run the business applications. And then there's a whole murky middle of all the AI stuff and things that are happening all the way in between. Our goal is to unify that around streaming data and make that available through all these different form factors to the different use cases that we need. So yes, we see it as incredibly complementary and we're excited to be working with the Databricks folks."}

And then maybe just one quick follow up. Ron mentioned that 2025 is the year of DSP, which is I think great to see, especially given it increasing in the mix of cloud revenue, I guess. How do you feel like what gives you the confidence that those trends continue? Are you starting to see, some anecdotal evidence of, of just like increased pipeline? What are, what are some of the tea leaves that you're reading that makes you suggest that to be the case?"}

So qualitative is, look, some of these things, the connector swing, they have massive open source adoption. So we just know that it's out there. We know that customers are excited about this or talking about it, want it as part of a managed cloud offering. And that comes out just in more or less every conversation we would have with our customers. There's really been an evolution of what's expected in the streaming world from just kind of the pure stream of data to a whole set of real time data capabilities. And we think we're kind of at the forefront of delivering that. The second bit is a little more quantitative which is, yes, we just, we look at the actual ramp and growth of consumption of these areas and the kind of forward looking pipeline we think we have for customers. A lot of the changes we've made in terms of our consumption transformation make us much better at tracking these workloads, driving, kind of product area by product area, the growth of these specific items."}

There's a lot of useful commentary throughout the prepared remarks, so appreciate that. Jay, I wanted to spend some time with you just speaking through what you're seeing in terms of Gen AI related use cases for streaming and or DSP technology. Is there commonality in terms of customers use cases you're seeing and maybe how you'd expect that to progress over the coming year?"}

So, if we think about the first wave of use cases, it was a lot of chatbots and the usage pattern there was hey, get the data for the AI. And so to kind of boil it down, it was basically real time ETL, like capture the data, be able to transform it into the right format, be able to store it in a way that's accessible and usable for a RAG application which is combining the stored data with LLM or language model. And we've seen a number of those kind of progress through to, things that are either internally facing in customers or externally facing. And so that was the first usage pattern was, get the data. The second usage pattern we're seeing is this ability to apply, language models kind of on the stream of data directly. Right. Carry out some actual use cases, something like say in insurance, customer may have a claim filed. There was a set of digital work that would happen, but there was also a set of manual work that would happen to actually prep, analyze, look at different documents. Being able to orchestrate that and take it further in the digital realm is a huge cost savings. It's a big quality improvement. And I think that's very much the goal that people have in the adoption of AI is not just more chat bots, but actually being able to plug this into parts of the business, have it take over some of the work that would otherwise be done by humans or augment that work in some way. And so I think that's the second pattern that we're starting to see rise up in customers."}

First of all, we're very pleased with our guide for Q1 and fiscal year 2025 for subscription. It is above the consensus estimates that were out there. And when you really look at the underlying drivers, I'll call out maybe three of them. Right. First is for the cloud business, we called out that we are comfortable with the estimates that are out there, which is roughly greater than 30% growth rate, give or take at a very high scale. And that's kind of underpinned by just the stability in the NRR that we spoke about in the second half of the year. The second aspect I'll call out is some of the drivers. The first driver is DSP that we spoke about. The DSP products are in their earlier stages of their growth curve. So obviously we have a lot of runway out there. So that's an opportunity. The second piece around the growth areas are some of the newer products that we spoke about. We just [Indiscernible] freight cluster. We're going to be gain Tableflow, Wall Street momentum. So that's a category number two and category number three is the partnerships that we spoke about, Jio and Databricks. And these partnerships are not only on the technology side but also on the go-to-market side. So the revenue contribution from the partnerships is probably not as material but these are all kind of drivers of growth as we look ahead into next year. What I'll tell you is when I take a step back, I think it's helpful to have multiple growth drivers and more importantly multiple parts to get to your objective. So that's how I categorize it."}

Jay, maybe just for starters, this past year you made transition in your go-to-market, changed up the incentives as we look to 2025, what's the big message coming out of sales kickoff? What adjustments, if any, are you making to the model that we should keep in mind that'll perhaps change incentives and behavior? Thanks."}

So obviously last year was a bigger transformation. We were changing a lot of the fundamental incentives, but that trickles down to even how we would track workloads with customers, our definition of pipeline, number of organizational changes to support it. I think one of the really positive things heading into this year is we feel like broadly those changes have been effective. It was a big adjustment. But heading into this year it's a much more minor set of tune ups which are kind of equivalent of what you would do heading into any new year where you kind of tune this aspect or that aspect of the comp plan. One of the big advantages in what we've done is we can now track and drive the specific workloads and the amount of each DSP component that's part of that is not just some generic commit to know, some raw number of dollars. It really is a set of use cases which are going to drive consumption of these individual new product areas and that allows us to drive it. So the -- we actually just had our sales kickoff this last week. A lot of fun, really positive energy, I think from the team. I came back pretty excited and with a little bit of a sore throat from talking so much. But yes, I think it resonated really well and people are excited to go take this out to all their customers."}

The best way to think about it is when I look at, say, 18 months back, our -- when you look at our pricing and packaging options that were out there, it was primarily our dedicated clusters and the standard and basic cluster, which were probably the 2 bookends. In the last 18-odd months, we've added enterprise SKU, which is essentially a multi-tenant, and it provides private networking, provides the right amount of security. Things like you can instead fly in private, you can fly commercial right now with Enterprise. And then we also came up with our freight clusters, which is essentially for high throughput, latency and sensitive workloads, you can do it at a very high TCO ROI. And then we acquired WarpStream, which is pretty similar to freight clusters, but doing it in your own infrastructure. When you kind of look at all of this, it is all around Confluent providing our customers with the right amount of ROI and TCO for all your workloads, not selective workloads. So that's the commentary around us being able to expand our serviceable addressable market and essentially take a step forward to our mission around looking up the World Kafka. I hope that helps."}

I guess the last piece of the question is or the piece of the puzzle is kind of the broader spending environment.

We've seen good broad-based adoption in the customer base. It takes time for them to kind of rebuild applications that they have. But overall, good strength in the build there, and we're kind of pleased with the progress and basically feel equally bullish as we would have Q1 of last year."}

Jay, I just want to ask you one thing. In our conversations with partners and customers, kind of notion has emerged that the agentic architecture, it's not only real-time data flows, but real-time data processing is kind of becoming important for agents to take decisions. Is that broadly true? Are you seeing kind of link patents attach rates higher for Agentic work flows? And then one for Rohan. Anyway to understand like how -- what is assumed within the guidance for 2025 around DSP mix and Flink mix?"}
{"doc_type": "earnings_call", "ticker": "CFLT", "period": "2024_Q4", "date": "2025-02-11", "section": "qa", "speaker": "Jay Kreps", "text": "Yes, it's a really insightful question. This is actually the topic of my keynote for the last current conference that we held in the U.S. for our customer base, and I talked about some of these use cases. Exactly as you say, I talked in the previous question about these agents that are actually reacting to what's happening in the business, right? So you could see the streams of data as being a little bit like the sensory system that's saying, hey, what's happening, being able to take bits of work as they come in, act on them, produce whatever output to the rest of the business. That is fundamentally a stream processing problem. However, you tackle it. And so yes, we feel like the technology we have in that space is particularly relevant. The advantage of using this kind of streaming technology is very much that you can kind of take the input data run it against it, look at the output, run it again, tweak your model, try a different model, add new context information, bring together other information you have. So yes, I think it's very applicable. And if anything, one of the interesting things that's happening in the AI world, with relationship to the older machine learning is, in some sense, the action is kind of moving into real time, prior to Confluent I worked at LinkedIn, one of the teams we had was a big data science team that would do model building, right? And so the role for string relative to that team would speed a bunch of stuff into some lake, and they would go offline and kind of build some models that would eventually be kind of shipped out. But each model is very specific to the problem being soft. If you think about what's happening in the new world, companies aren't building as many bespoke models. We're mostly getting your model prebuilt off of a very large general purpose data set mostly what you're doing is applying your specific contact data with the model at inference time at run time. That's kind of the RAG architecture. So if you think about, well, what's the resulting data infrastructure from that? It's going from this kind of off-line processing to something that's very much online, that's in sync with the business, and that's obviously advantageous, I think, for folks in the streaming world."}

When I think about DSP consumption, it grew substantially faster than the overall cloud business in Q4. And as I mentioned, it accounted for roughly 13% of our cloud business, which we're obviously very pleased with. And as I think ahead, all the key components of the DSP are in the earlier stages of their growth curve. And we expect them to be material drivers of growth for the next couple of years. And specifically for 2025 well, I'm not going to get into exact numbers. We expect that to increase as we go through the year."}

One question, but multiple parts, so you guys can both answer. I guess I'd like to focus a little bit on your $1 million customer or success upmarket. What's driving that are customers getting to that $1 million bogey quicker, especially as you move to the DSP platform. And for Ro, long-term deferred revenue up $20 million sequentially kind of sticks out, especially given the move to consumption. So maybe you can address that. Thank you."}
{"doc_type": "earnings_call", "ticker": "CFLT", "period": "2024_Q4", "date": "2025-02-11", "section": "qa", "speaker": "Jay Kreps", "text": "Yes, I'll take the first part of that. Yes, obviously, a large part of what we're trying to do is build the journey from that first use case to a large cross-company platform that has a significant portion of the data and application workloads in the company. And that's a big project in each one of these customers. And everything we do is about how can we accelerate it. So when we think about services offerings, partnerships, features, it's all about how can we build the journey and make that easier for customers to achieve in particular, a lot of the DSP functionality is very much that, right? So the connectors make it really easy instead of having to come in and build a bunch of custom integration. You can just plug this into the things that you have and have streams of data flowing. Flink makes it much easier to build real-time applications that are fall tolerant and scalable and correct and work with the language, as you know, like SQL, which is kind of the lingua franca of the data world. And similar with the kind of governance functionality that makes this actually usable across the organization, and we do see that flywheel, right? Indeed, as customers adopt these things, we see greater usage of the core streams of data. And so we think very much that as these things spin up, they all kind of feed off of each other, and that should very much take customers more quickly to larger scale within the organization. And I think that we're starting to see realization of that. So for CIOs, CTOs, engineering leaders, as they're thinking about an overall data strategy, as they're thinking about what's needed for AI, I do think this is a very important piece that they're thinking about and starting to contemplate the role of the data streaming place and that kind of broad understanding of our space has not always been there. In the early days of the company, it was not -- but I do think that, that's a key accelerant when you think about getting customers to buy in, to build around something and to take it to a large scale quickly."}
{"doc_type": "earnings_call", "ticker": "CFLT", "period": "2024_Q4", "date": "2025-02-11", "section": "qa", "speaker": "Rohan Sivaram", "text": "Rob, I'll add a couple of quick points to what Jay just said, then I will go to the deferred revenue base. On the total customer -- large customer ecosystem, I also called out that when you look at our 100K plus ARR customers, that cohort now basically contributes approximately 90% of our subscription revenue. And when I -- and then when you look at our $1 million-plus customer and you look at the last 12 months, the momentum has been great. So I'll give you a different lens as in when I think about consumption, there are probably 3 drivers of consumption, right? You have an existing use case and there is more data flowing through that. That's number one. The second area is our ability to unlock net new use cases. And with AI, that's obviously a lever of growth. And the third, albeit in the early days is us selling DSP into our existing customer base. So the opportunity with our existing customers is still pretty large, just to add to what you said. Now going back to your second question around deferred revenue. Honestly, not a whole lot to read into it. Like I said, when you look at the revenue or RPO, that's probably not the only indicator for the organic momentum of the business purely because how we think about cloud, we are consumption first and we're truly not leading with the largest commit possible. It's all around unlocking the concession and working with the customer around it. So changes in deferred revenue is primarily driven by timing of large content platform, multiyear deals. So not a whole lot of read to do it."}

Jay, Rohan and Shane, good to see you guys. Jay, I was wondering since we've had the benefit of a year of the rollout of the new model and we brought in Flink in the fold. How satisfied are you with tilt towards compensating salespeople through consumption. Because I think the year back or the hope was that we come out of this with the ability to grow even faster and allow customers to consume even more freely, more faster. And what are the things we should be watching for to ensure that, that is happening, maybe net expansion rates are not there yet. The cloud growth rate could be hitting an inflection point maybe that is still ahead. So how satisfied are you that we've seen or are we begin to see the effect of the fruits of all the actions that were put in the last year. And also second finally, if you have the time, if AI were to be a tailwind for the company, where would it show up in the way that people like us can read in the financial statements. Thank you so much once again."}
{"doc_type": "earnings_call", "ticker": "CFLT", "period": "2024_Q4", "date": "2025-02-11", "section": "qa", "speaker": "Jay Kreps", "text": "Yes. So to the first question. Yes, there's really two things we're trying to achieve. One is really match the way our customers were buying and thinking about the type of product that we offer, make it easier for them to land, make it easier for them to expand and add workloads. The second was to be in a position to really drive adoption of DSP around our cloud. And I think we exit this last year, entered this year -- have a position to do both of those. And that was very much the objective. I think that's a much better position to be in relative to what we're doing with customers. I think it means we're tracking the kind of individual workloads that they're bringing out to production. And so, yes, I do view that as a growth driver for us over time. And as a necessary step to be in sync with the peer companies and in sync with the new offer we want to bring to market. To the latter question on AI use cases, yes, I think it's really about the broader set of these coming into production usage that's we're going to see this happen. I think you would see it both in the kind of customer references, we've shared some of the ones that we've seen so far as well as in the kind of overall growth numbers for the company. But there's obviously not a broken out category. I don't think it's necessarily disproportionate cloud or CP, we see use cases across both. So yes, I don't think you would see it a single customer stat that we produce."}

It's great to see everyone and congrats on a strong finish of the year. Jay, in your prepared remarks, you mentioned a couple of customer examples where I think -- I believe they're replacing traditional data integration vendors with Confluent. I believe to date, though, a Confluent -- most of Confluent's new business has come from replacing open source Kafka for real-time use cases. But it seems like now you're going maybe more direct rip and replace of commercial data integration vendors for batch [ph] processing. And I'm not sure if this is always the case on what the historical mix has been, but can you confirm if that is true that you're winning more of these larger commercial batch workloads. And if that is the case, is that changing your go-to-market at all, the types of prospects you're targeting and how you're targeting them?"}
{"doc_type": "earnings_call", "ticker": "CFLT", "period": "2024_Q4", "date": "2025-02-11", "section": "qa", "speaker": "Jay Kreps", "text": "Yes. It's a really good question. So I would say we've -- it's always been the case that we've been replacing call it, other legacy integration technologies that's not solely new. However, often our first land was a conversion of OpenSource Kafka. Now of course, the OpenSource Kafka may have replaced some legacy data integration. I think it may have been a net new project. But one of the things we've always found is whatever that initial land is as customers get to scale, they start to think about the portfolio of technology and what is it that they want to bet on going forward. And they start to have a plan of what they're divesting and what they're investing in. And I do think it's very much the case in our large customers so that they see data streaming as the future of how data flows across the organization. And I think that, that does just place a number of the existing vendors in that space. And I think they are looking at replacing that. Now can we land directly against those use cases. I think the answer is increasingly often, yes, right? One of the things that's happened is there's more awareness of the data streaming space overall. And also, as our product is more complete, having out of the box set of connectors that plug in, having transformation capabilities, it is more of a apples-to-apples replacement of some of these things was something that's net better. It's more scalable, it's real time. That's an open application platform that has a lot of benefits, but actually can just kind of just place a lot of woods there. And so yes, I do think we're seeing more of that."}

Jay, it sounds like WarpStream got off to a very good start. And so you have three types of deployment mechanisms, each of them valuable for different reasons in addition to things like freight clusters. That being said, could this potentially lead to a little more customer deliberation a slight lengthening of sales cycles as part of that decision-making process? Or is that really not a concern from your perspective?"}
{"doc_type": "earnings_call", "ticker": "CFLT", "period": "2024_Q4", "date": "2025-02-11", "section": "qa", "speaker": "Jay Kreps", "text": "Yes. It's not a huge concern. Obviously, any time you're adding more packages or options, you want to be cognizant of that. But we thought that actually when you look at cost workloads, there's a fair amount of diversity. And so the first order thing to do is make sure that you have a really excellent TCO story deployment story set of capabilities for each of those. And you can kind of walk into a customer and say, hey, tell me what you're doing. We've got the right solution for all of these things kind of out of the box. And one of the things I mentioned we had our sales kick off. One of the things that I talk our team about and that a lot of our product leaders talked about was the fact that entering this year, we really felt like we were in this position where across every use case, we were dramatically superior to whatever the customer is doing in the streaming space. And then it could be kind of a no-brainer both on functionality, but also on price. From a very large scale to the kind of early starter stuff to the very high SLA, but maybe not is, really across the board, we had a very strong story. And that was a deliberate path over the course of last year. Now it does mean we've got more cluster types. But I think in any of these areas that succeed, like you look at the AWS product offerings. Sure, they start with three EC2 instances. As this gets more use, they do kind of fill out the matrix a little bit more to be able to really cover all the different compute needs that a customer may have. And I think that's actually kind of a very important part of maturity in this kind of cloud infrastructure. So net-net, we feel very good about the kind of full portfolio."}

Again, I'll start with 2024, Rudy. When I look at 2024, and I look at just a broad efficiency on the go-to-market side of the world. In fact, we improved our sales and marketing as a percentage of revenue in 2024 by roughly 6 percentage points. That essentially tells you that if we kind of gone through the year, we've gotten more and more efficient. So that's one aspect of it. And given our resource allocation philosophy, we're not going to lose sight of that. That's going to be a continued focus for us, us getting more and more efficient as we deliver try to deliver and deliver durable growth. When you have another thing to -- where we are from a capacity standpoint at the beginning of the year, we feel good with the capacity we have. We've had a good hiring year towards the latter half of 2024. So we have the capacity on board to deliver on the plans that we have for 2025."}

So data gravity, truly important when you look at all the strategic moves and acquisitions made by these large data platforms, a lot of them tied back into data gravity.

So if you look at the kind of broad trends that we're seeing the rise of AI and push of a lot of the analytics world more into real-time that continued investment in a set of different data platforms across the rise of the public cloud but the endurance of some of the on premise stuff, net-net, the connectivity between all of this is really important and more of the workloads are moving into this kind of operational, continuous processing world. So yes, it's a phenomenal setup for streaming. What inning are we inning in, we are a very early inning. So if you add up the dollar spend on batch processing, is large file dollars, right? If you say, what percentage of those dollars have moved to streaming, well, a good percent we're excited to talk about it every quarter, but there's a lot more dollars to go and that -- I think that's an exciting thing for us. And I think as we talked about before, what this area encompasses is both a set of data integration, kind of bespoke half worked out data integration verticals, but also a set of application workloads that were maybe running off-line at the end of the day and are moving into the operation of the business. Both of those are very exciting opportunities. Both of those are being done by our customers today and the scope of those is expanding both with the kind of DSP capabilities we're bringing as well as the continued expansion in these customers as this becomes a critical data platform for that."}

{"doc_type": "earnings_call", "ticker": "CFLT", "period": "2023_Q3", "date": "2023-11-01", "section": "prepared", "speaker": "Jay Kreps", "text": "Thanks, Shane. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to our third quarter earnings call. We delivered a solid Q3, exceeding the high end of total revenue, operating margin and EPS guided range in a still challenging macroeconomic environment. Total revenue grew 32% to $200 million. Non-GAAP operating margin improved 22 percentage points, and non-GAAP EPS turned positive for the first time, a key milestone. We've now driven 36 percentage points of operating margin improvement over the last two years. I want to thank our entire employee base for the tremendous progress here. The Confluent Cloud remains the fastest-growing part of our business, with revenue up 61% to $92 million. It fell slightly below our guidance. Our Q4 revenue outlook is impacted as well. We expect revenue growth of 21% to 22% with cloud revenue sequential add of $6 million, representing growth of 43%. The lower cloud revenue this quarter impact to guidance for Q4 is primarily driven by two factors: First, the impact from two large digital native customers. One online gaming company moved workloads back to their own data center, and one of our largest customers ramped slower as they are in the process of being acquired. We believe consumption from these two customers was impacted by their company-specific events and accounts for roughly 50% of the expected consumption shortfall for Q4. Second, the continuing macro pressure, including the ongoing conflict in the Middle East, where Israel is a top 10 country for us and the possible U.S. government shutdown, both of which add uncertainty and disruption in particular segments. Specifically, we've seen slower organic consumption resulting from a slower rate of new use case additions in some part of our customer base. Rohan will provide more details on our resulting guidance in the later section of the call. I want to spend some time now focusing on a critical change we're making to drive growth. Beyond just the friction in the current market environment, the critical project for Confluent is to capture the massive market opportunity in streaming. This is a $60 billion market where we are still just scratching the surface of even the existing open source Kafka usage. And we have additional expansion opportunities from Flink, our connectors and data governance, as I outlined in the earnings call last time. Critical to our execution against this opportunity is leveraging our go-to-market engine to rapidly land new customers, expand new workloads and ensure the adoption of our full set of product capabilities. To this end, we'll be completing the transition to orient our cloud business around consumption. This will make cloud revenue rather than bookings or committed spend the primary goal of the go-to-market organization for Confluent Cloud. This was a planned transition. Indeed, we began changes in this direction this year, but it’s a transition we’ll be significantly accelerating heading into 2024. To explain what this means, let me start with a little background. In the traditional world of on-premise software, customers would make big upfront commitments. Salespeople worked with the customer to scope these commitments and were paid as a percentage of the resulting bookings. The marketing organization measured pipeline based on these commitments, and every internal system and process was oriented around measuring and managing the bookings that resulted. There was some misalignment between customer and vendor because customer might end up over purchasing, but this was masked by the fact that the rest of the stack, such as servers that ran the software, were also fundamentally upfront in inelastic purchases. With the advent of the cloud and the elasticity and flexibility it offered to customers, this model had to evolve. Cloud has a utility-like model where services are metered as they are used. However, in the early days, the go-to-market engine for cloud infrastructure software largely remained as it was previously, selling customer commitments or credits that overlaid this dynamic usage. Alignment between customer and vendor improved somewhat, but the vendor still had an incentive to maximally scope customer commitments. Over the last couple of years, businesses like MongoDB, Snowflake, Datadog and hyperscalers have all transitioned their go-to-market to a fully consumption-based model. In this model, the customer and the go-to-market organization are both oriented around the actual service usage, not the upfront commitment. This fully aligns the customer value realization with the vendor's revenue. Less obvious from the outside is how this completely upends the sales and marketing model. Pipeline is no longer oriented around maximum customer commitment, but rather new logos and new workloads. Salespeople aren't compensated for getting an upfront booking, but rather for what a customer actually uses, finding new workloads and driving new product adoption. This is an absolute win for customers and also a huge win for vendors, who are actually able to grow faster by removing much of the uncertainty and risk from customer purchasing. With Confluent Cloud now at nearly 50% of our revenue, having NRR over 140% and continuing rapid growth, it's time for Confluent to complete our transition to this fully consumption-based model. We've already made the transition to usage-based pricing that bills for what is used. But today, our go-to-market is still primarily oriented around booking customer commitments. The final step in our consumption journey is to now fully align our go-to-market operations to the consumption motion. This directly attaches our go-to-market efforts to cloud revenue and to our customers' value realization. This is one of the most important possible growth levers for Confluent. It is also necessary that we do this now. As we've seen across the industry this last year, economic pressure combined with the changing norm in cloud means customers are increasingly reluctant to make large multiyear commitments ahead of their usage. This means over the course of this year, the misalignment between our subscription-based good market and the natural buying behavior of customers has increased, creating a drag in our cloud growth. This is shown up in the dislocation between RPO and cloud revenue, but ultimately affects both as our interaction with customers are directed in a way that is out of sync with the customers' natural buying behavior. We believe this change will turn what is currently a drag into a tailwind. This is not a new plan for Confluent, we'd originally planned to make this shift over a three-year period beginning with steps this year. However, in light of the change we've seen in buying behavior, we’ll be accelerating this and completing the transition next year. In practical terms, here's what this means. First, beginning in Q1 of FY24, we're shifting from our current model where 10% to 15% of cloud sales compensation is based on consumption to a model where 100% of cloud sales compensation is based on incremental consumption in new logo acquisition. We will keep the vast majority of our customer revenue under a committed contract, as we do today. However, we will not be attempting to get commitments ahead of the usage. Rather committed amounts will be customer-driven as customers choose to commit in exchange for greater discounts. Second, we're fully orienting our field-facing teams towards landing new customers and driving new workloads with customers. Third, we'll be adapting our product and pricing to enable customers to frictionlessly try and adopt new products, enabling easier lands and adoption of new features. Finally, we'll be undergoing a significant reworking of our systems for planning, growth, building and measuring pipeline and forecasting performance as all shifts drive directly off cloud revenue. A number of our cloud-oriented peers have made this transition to a very positive effect. So the path and benefits are clear. Like the transition to the cloud we began several years ago, we expect to emerge stronger on the other side, more aligned with our customers and better positioned to capture the $60 billion opportunity in front of us. In September, we held Current 2023, the only industry event dedicated to the data streaming ecosystem. It was a high-energy event and a fantastic illustration of the excitement and innovation around data streaming. The event included speakers from BMW, NASA, Nationwide, Snowflake and Uber and many others, as well as thousands of practitioners who gathered to discuss the state of the art data stream. One of the things I'm most proud of is the velocity of product innovation the team has sustained over this last year, and I think our announcements at Current are great illustration of this. We announced a new tier of Kafka cluster, Enterprise clusters which offer many of the advantages of our dedicated clusters like private networking and enhanced security, but include instant elasticity and our served multi-tenant of our core stack. This allows a better price point for customers and significantly lower serving costs for Confluent. These lower cost clusters are perfectly aligned to our consumption transformation, since they lower the entry point price but scale up automatically as you need them. Data Portal is an important new addition to our stream governance suite that brings our vision for discoverable and reusable data streams to the forefront of Conclude Cloud. The excitement around Flink at Current was palpable. Flink sessions were among the highest rated and most attended sessions at the entire conference, highlighting the hunger Kafka users have for Flink. That's why we're so pleased with the launch of Flink public preview in Confluent Cloud. Since the announcement, we've seen incredible uptake with hundreds of customers opting into the preview and trying out our cloud-native and serverless Flink offering. The addition of Flink strengthens our position as the only complete data streaming product. We bring Flink together with the connectors that capture streaming data, the stream itself in Kafka and the governance capabilities to manage streaming data across an organization. Each of these capabilities strengthens the other, and the combination comprise what we believe will be the most important data platform in a modern company. And finally, we introduced data streaming for AI, a set of new partnerships that span vector databases, CSPs and SIs. It also includes new product capabilities, including the Confluent AI assistant that will turn natural language inputs into helpful suggestions and code. We expect this initiative to address the demand we're seeing across our customers who are building innovative new AI applications. A great example of this is Notion. Notion is an AI-powered connected workspace where modern teams can create and share documents, take notes, manage projects and organize knowledge all in one place. Given Notion's strong growth, a new data streaming platform was needed to meet its rapidly expanding needs. However, due to the lean engineering team, they required a fully managed service to focus on product development rather than managing Kafka. They began using Confluent Cloud for real-time data flows for internal analytics pipelines and to supply data into data lakes. After realizing the value it provided, Notion expanded the usage of Confluent Cloud to enhance product features, including search automation and Notion AI. Now Notion’s customers can automate tasks in real time, such as adding summaries, extracting key points and consolidating action items in meeting notes. This is only the beginning as Notion continues to innovate and actively explore how data streaming can power new AI applications. Before turning things over to Rohan, I wanted to reiterate a couple of key points. We're incredibly excited about the tailwinds to the business, Flink, data governance, AI and the rest of the data streaming platform components add to our business. And while it may cause some short-term headwinds, I firmly believe our accelerated transformation to a fully consumption-oriented business will put us in an incredibly strong position to drive the monetization of these new offerings. I've never been more confident in our ability to be the leader in the emerging $60 billion data streaming market. With that, I'll turn things over to Rohan."}
{"doc_type": "earnings_call", "ticker": "CFLT", "period": "2023_Q3", "date": "2023-11-01", "section": "prepared", "speaker": "Rohan Sivaram", "text": "Thanks, Jay. Q3 demonstrates our ability to drive efficient growth in a challenging macroeconomic environment. Key highlights include robust subscription revenue growth, coupled with proactive management of rate and pace of investments which drove record higher gross margin, 20-plus point of operating margin improvements and our first positive non-GAAP EPS quarter. I'd like to take a moment to thank our employees and partners for their contributions in delivering these key milestones for the Company. Turning to Q3 results. Total revenue grew 32% to $200.2 million, exceeding our guidance. Subscription revenue grew faster, up 36% to $189.3 million. Within subscription, Confluent Platform revenue growth reaccelerated to 19%, ending the quarter at $97.7 million or 49% of total revenue and was driven by continued strength in regulated industries as companies in those industries are still early in their journey of moving to the cloud. Confluent Cloud revenue grew 61% to $91.6 million, slightly below our guidance of $92.2 million and ended the quarter at 46% of revenue compared to 38% of revenue a year ago and 44% last quarter. As Jay called out earlier, cloud revenue performance in the quarter was modestly impacted by two large customers: One large online gaming customer who moved workloads back to their own data center from the public cloud as part of our broad internal cloud strategy review; and one of our largest customers who ramped slower than expected as they are currently in the process of being acquired. Additionally, we saw lower-than-expected consumption in a few other large U.S. digital native customers. While these select customers did have an impact on Q3, especially in the last few weeks of the quarter, we expect to see a greater impact throughout Q4 and next year. I'll cover more on this in a second. Turning to the geographical mix of revenue. Revenue from the U.S. grew 25% to $119.4 million. Revenue from outside the U.S. grew 43% to $80.8 million. We continue to be pleased with the relative balance of our business around the world. Moving on to rest of the income statement, I'll be referring to non-GAAP results unless otherwise stated. Total gross margins reached a record high of 76.4%, up 540 basis points. This translates to 80.1% subscription gross margin, up 320 basis points, despite a continued revenue mix shift to cloud. Gross margin outperformance was driven by continued improvement in the unit economics and in product optimizations of our cloud business and our R&D investments in Kora, the cloud-native engine of our Confluent Cloud offering. Turning to profitability and cash flow. Operating margin improved 22 percentage points to negative 5.5%, representing our fifth consecutive quarter of more than 10 points in improvement. Q3 operating margin outperformance was driven by disciplined spending and ROI-focused investment philosophy across every function of the Company. And we are pleased to achieve our first positive net income per share of $0.02 for Q3, using 303.9 million basic and 347 million diluted weighted average shares outstanding. Fully diluted share count under the treasury stock method was approximately 355.4 million. Free cash flow margin improved 24 percentage points to negative 6.5%. We ended the third quarter with $1.87 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. Turning now to other business metrics. In Q3, we added 80 net new customers, 41 customers with $100,000 or more in ARR and 8 customers with $1 million or more in ARR, bringing our total customer count to approximately 4,910, up 16%. Our $100,000-plus customer count to 1,185, up 25% and our $1 million-plus customer count to 155, up 38%. NRR in the quarter was healthy, just under 130%. NRR for hybrid and cloud were both comfortably above 130% with cloud NRR continuing to be the highest. Gross retention rate remained strong and was above 90%. Consistent with Jay's comments about the drivers behind the shift to consumption, RPO was $824.1 million, up 24%. Current RPO, estimated to be 65% of RPO was $535.1 million, up 31%. RPO growth was impacted by a decline in both average deal sizes and average contract duration, a continuation of the trends we had called out last quarter. In the current macro environment, we believe customers have less appetite for larger upfront commitments and prefer consumption against smaller commits, reflecting a consumption-first trend in how our customers derive value from Confluent. Now, turning to our Q4 outlook. We have factored in our guidance the impact of the following: First, we expect to have a full quarter impact from the two large customers mentioned earlier, whose consumption is impacted by their company-specific events around the shift of workloads back to on-prem and an acquisition. We estimate that these two customers account for roughly 50% of the expected consumption shortfall in Q4. Second, the macro uncertainty, including the ongoing geopolitical tensions will likely persist, impacting new use case deployments into production and driving lower-than-expected consumption. As Jay discussed earlier, the current macro has increased the misalignment between our subscription-based go-to-market and the new buying behavior of customers, which creates a drag in our consumption growth. We believe our accelerated move to a fully consumption-oriented comp model for Confluent Cloud will turn this drag into a tailwind for our business. Turning now to guidance. For the fourth quarter of 2023, we expect revenue to be in the range of $204 million to $205 million, representing growth of 21% to 22%. Cloud revenue to be approximately $97.5 million, a sequential add of $6 million, representing growth of 43% and accounting for approximately 48% of total revenue based on the midpoint of our guide. Non-GAAP operating margin to be in the range of 0% to 1% and non-GAAP net income per share to be approximately $0.05. Additionally, we expect the free cash flow margin to be in the range of 0% to 1%. For the full year 2023, we expect revenue to be in the range of $768 million to $769 million, representing growth of 31%, non-GAAP operating margin to be approximately negative 9%, and non-GAAP net loss per share in the range of negative $0.01 to $0.00. Looking ahead, I'd like to provide an early read into our outlook for next year. Our fiscal year '24 preliminary outlook assumes the impact of a continued volatile macroeconomic and geopolitical environment, the dynamics mentioned earlier for Q4 continuing into 2024, and risk associated with our transformation to a fully consumption-oriented business. If macro were to improve, we would expect to benefit from it, but it is too early to tell. Given these factors for the full year 2024, we expect revenue to grow approximately 22% year-over-year, non-GAAP operating margin to break even, improving approximately 9 percentage points year-over-year. This is despite a 2- to 3-point headwind associated with our move to a consumption-based sales commission plan, resulting in higher upfront expense recognition. And we expect free cash flow margin to break even. I'd like to highlight a few things about our consumption transformation. Despite potential near-term top line impacts on our fiscal year '24 outlook, we expect the transformation will enhance our ability to drive durable and efficient growth over both the midterm and long term and will put us in a stronger position to capture our $60 billion market opportunity. We believe subscription revenue, which captures ACV from Confluent Platform and consumption from Confluent Cloud will be the best indicator of our success. Starting Q1 next year, we will include subscription revenue in our key financial metrics and move our quarterly and annual revenue guidance metric to subscription revenue. And consistent with that, RPO and CRPO will be less relevant as a forward-looking indicator given the greater emphasis on consumption over ACV-based commits for cloud. We expect our non-GAAP operating margin midterm target of 5% to 10% and long-term target of greater than 25% to be firmly intact and for free cash flow margin to continue to trend roughly in line with operating margin. In closing, we are pleased with delivering a solid Q3 in a challenging environment. Our net and gross retention rates remain strong, reflecting the durability and resiliency of our growth. We remain committed to driving growth and improving profitability while transforming our cloud business to be fully consumption oriented, and we are excited about capturing our market opportunity ahead. Now Jay and I will take your questions."}

Jay, the spending environment hasn't been particularly great kind of all year. And so, I wanted to get a sense of outside of those two customers that may be a little bit idiosyncratic, like what's changed in the environment? When did you start to see the change in the quarter? And how much of that would you attribute to macro versus just sales execution?"}
{"doc_type": "earnings_call", "ticker": "CFLT", "period": "2023_Q3", "date": "2023-11-01", "section": "qa", "speaker": "Jay Kreps", "text": "Yes. Yes, it's a great question. So obviously, the two customers are kind of a significant impact, but particular circumstances in each. I do think we've felt kind of pressure on the number of net new software projects that are just getting funded throughout the year, and we've talked about that. Kind of building over time, that's the motivation for this full shift to consumption that I talked about. I think when I think about our execution, there's always something in one customer or another that could be done better, but the biggest systematic thing is really making sure we're lining up to drive the adoption in new projects, making sure that we're attaching to each thing that's happening. This is something we've watched in peer companies and it's worked really well for them. And I think just because we're a younger organization, we're maybe a year or two behind in that journey. And what we saw over the course of the year is definitely customers adapted to this environment, the combination of pressure on IT budgets, along with the switch in the behavior of our peers has really led people to kind of consume and then commit as it were. And you really want to have then your go-to-market motion focused on the consumption side of things like really driving the adoption and the use cases that becomes extra important. And so, on the execution side, I think that's absolutely the biggest change we can make. And we're just very excited about the impact that can have. I mean, obviously, there's some adjustment period as you go through switching all your internal systems and a number of the different definitions from pipeline to comp, et cetera. And of course, even adjusting some of the sales motions. But if you think about why we're doing it, it really is to be able to align that to attaching to the next new project, making sure that that has streaming and Confluent as part of it, making sure that these new components of the data streaming platform, Flink and the connectors and the governance capabilities, making sure that that gets adopted and the customers are really consuming that. That's far and away the biggest lever we feel like we have to drive additional growth."}

And then Rohan, for you, I guess the question is in terms of your initial view into calendar 2024. I guess my question is that for Q4 of 2023, you're guiding to 21% to 22% and then for next year, you're guiding essentially sustained growth? And how did you come up with the 22% number? And do you see any risk or sustained growth going into 2024, given what you're calling out from a sales force transition perspective, from a macro perspective? Just love a little clarity on how you set up the 2024 guidance."}

Yes, when thinking about our 2024 guide, I kind of put it into three buckets. Starting off with, we called out the two large customers that had impact, although customer specific implications, but that will have an impact into Q4 as well as 2024. The second category is around the macro, which, I'd say, a combination of geopolitical exposure to Israel, coupled with the slowdown in the new cases that we've been seeing. And the third category is the consumption transformation. And as Jay just called out, any time you go through a transformation like this, there's going to be this adjustment factor. And we are trying to prudently bake in that impact of that into our guidance. So, taking a step back, these are the three drivers that impacted our guidance. But when you think about the first half versus second half, we expect like the second half to be better off slightly than the first half, clearly because the consumption transformation will have, I would say, a larger impact in the first half of the year. I mean, I also want to call out, Sanjit, that as we are exiting 2024, there will be a decent amount of tailwinds. First of all, the consumption transformation, which we expect will be behind us and which will reduce the friction between our go-to-market teams as well as how our customers want to buy our products. Second, I mean, we'll have a decent amount of product tailwind behind us. We'll have Flink, we'll have GA about 6 months in and a couple of other unlocks from the data streaming platform perspective, coupled with FedRAMP and AI. So we feel that exiting 2024, we feel pretty good with where we are and just in general, from a long-term perspective."}

And it certainly is tough out there. And really appreciate the disclosure and granularity that you've given us. I wanted Jay to hone in on the one customer that you said is moving back into their own data center. Because that's not something we typically hear. We've heard about this notion of repatriating cloud workloads, but it's hard to actually find it. So, any context that you can add as to why on earth that might be happening, why that particular customer wouldn't have been use Confluent Platform at that point? And any reason to believe that this is the beginning of a trend?"}

So yes, like you always hear a little bit about this like move out of the cloud. And by and large, we don't see it, maybe in the history of the Company, I could say one or two examples where that's happened. But yes, I don't think it's a broad-based trend. It's definitely motivated by cost. When you think about the kind of pressure on IT budgets, it's far and away the most significant in the digital native sector. These are companies that, in some cases, are cutting 30% of spend. And so, that means very significant adjustments. In this particular company that is coupled with the strategy of moving stuff out of the cloud into their data centers, and Kafka and Confluent kind of gets dragged along with that. We're in discussions with them on Confluent Platform, but that kind of overall shift is not something that's Confluent specific, it's part of a broader strategy."}

The new enterprise cluster that you’ve announced at Current, sounds like it's really powerful. How much might this present a headwind to consumption as it seems you're making customers way more efficient, requiring fewer reserve instances? And is that something that you contemplated in the guide that you've given us?"}
{"doc_type": "earnings_call", "ticker": "CFLT", "period": "2023_Q3", "date": "2023-11-01", "section": "qa", "speaker": "Jay Kreps", "text": "Yes. I mean, of course, that and all these other factors are baked into what we've given, but we think that's a tailwind. So when we think about aligning to the consumption transformation, a lot of that is on the go-to-market side, but it's also about the product. We want people to be able to land with the least amount of friction possible. And then we want to make expansion as easy and automatic as possible. And so, it's hard to stress how much better it is when we move things from an instance of Kora that's running dedicated to that customer to something multi-tenant, what happens is the customer experience gets much better because the cluster is just to spend instantly as you need it. There's no kind of manual invocation you have to make. And secondly, it's obviously very positive for Confluent in terms of the efficiency. So, it allows us to do something that's a better deal for the customer, but really a much better deal for Confluent as well. So, it's kind of positive on both sides. And our goal in this is to take a lot of this friction out of the system in adoption and expansion, make it as easy as possible to land the first use case and make it as automatic as possible for customers to expand. So yes, we expect it's a tailwind, even though you may be starting at a lower initial price point."}

Jay, I think there was a comment made that as you exit this transition, the Company is going to be in a better position. So can you just recap for us how structurally you're able to prosecute a better TAM more easily because of the switch in your go-to-market model? And secondly, just to post the devil's advocate, is the cloud platform missing certain things that you have to lower the barrier by giving an alternative to go easy on the consumption? Because I wonder what did this customer, gaming customers saw that that they felt compelled to put it in the data center and not get the benefits of the cloud. Is there something missing on the cloud platform side itself by way of functionality, whatnot this customer might have seen that we might be missing here that you plan to introduce in the functionality set becomes less of a friction point going forward."}
{"doc_type": "earnings_call", "ticker": "CFLT", "period": "2023_Q3", "date": "2023-11-01", "section": "qa", "speaker": "Jay Kreps", "text": "Yes. Let me address both. The first, I think, is more bigger picture, like, hey, how does this change -- does this change the market or our ability to address the market, how and why. So, I'll start with that big picture question. So like, yes, I think the opportunity in streaming is as big as ever, probably better even than it was a year ago. I mean, if you just talk to customers, the level of excitement in this space, the adoption of stream processing, all of that is really at the forefront of people's minds. We just had Current, our conference, had a number of customer conversations there. This is something people are absolutely thinking about. In the current environment, all of these forward-looking transformations in our customers, they have to moderate the pace, right? So whether it's cloud adoption, the move to real-time streaming, all of this stuff is happening a little slower. But this is absolutely right at the top of their agenda. So, I don't think any aspect of that changes. And then, yes, exiting '24 what are kind of the tailwinds? I think Rohan did a good job of speaking to this. So, you want it to be the case that the energy we're devoting in our go-to-market organization is about finding these use cases, making sure they're adopting the full part of the product, really consuming all the aspects of the data streaming platform, Flink, the connectors, our Kafka offering, all of it. And you're doing that as rapidly as possible across the organization. And so, the -- what's important to get right in that is get all the systems pointing in that direction. And then that really becomes a driver for growth. What you don't want is something where you're very focused on the amount of the commitment and trying to get customers to commit ahead of these projects, that kind of puts them into too much of an analysis paralysis of trying to scope out every new application you're going to build -- how much is it going to consume exactly, commit exactly to that amount, that ends up being effectively wasted time versus just getting them going and getting them to use the product. I think you've seen this change in effectively all the PR companies. For those that start with an on-premise offering as we do, they have to introduce it gradually as they have enough cloud revenue to really make it make sense, as we do now, right? For those who were kind of born with a cloud-only offering, this is perhaps the native thing they started with or perhaps there was some adjustment earlier in the life cycle. So, that's the change. That's why we're doing it. It's had positive impact for all the peers. We expect it will have that exact same impact for us. And of course, as we prosecute that, we want to make sure we get the impact as soon as possible, right? So, we've, I think, prudently baked some impact into the first half of the year that, hey, we think as we kind of change all our systems, there's some adjustment period involved in that. But yes, as we're exiting the year, we think that's absolutely a tailwind. And that combines with and in many ways, accelerates these new product offerings that we're adding, the connectors, governance, Flink offerings, they're really coming to maturity throughout the course of that year. Some of the security unlocks that like the work that we're doing on FedRAMP, also being able to address other kind of regulated industries. That's a significant unlock. Those things are really powerful in allowing us to take on more use cases, more completely with less work from customers. And of course, these are mostly line items that customer purchases directly. So allowing us to increase the spend with customers. And then yes, is there something missing that we would make changes like this? I don't think so. I mean, if you look at peer companies, of course, there's always more we can do in our product, and we continue to invest and innovate. But this idea of just aligning to consumption, trying to make that as low friction as possible, that's actually really important for us. And especially the shift of workloads into multi-tenancy it's kind of just net positive, even though that entry price can be a little bit lower, the cost to us is so much lower that it's just disproportionately much better. It's exactly what you want to have happen. And that takes a lot of the friction out of the conversation. And this is really important in tighter environments where customers have to think not just about the TCO and the payoff, but exactly that transition cost in time and do they have the ability to get from here to there. You want to make that a new brainer. So the customers can just get up and get going. That to us is key when we look at all the open source usage, we want to go scoop that up as quickly as possible."}

And every year, the total spend on cloud as a percentage of IT spend goes up. And so I just don't think it's a broad-based trend. That one I do think is a specific instance in that customer. If you think about what's the kind of overall pressure that causes stuff like that, it is this kind of pressure on efficiency and spend, and companies do different things to try and get that. This is what they happen to pursue. So, the right adjustment to us is not something where we advocate for customers not to move back into their data centers. The right adjustment is this consumption transformation, like really line up make it as easy as possible to expand and attach to projects. That's going to be the thing that really drives us forward kind of broadly across the customer base."}

I appreciate the details you're breaking out. Is there anything new that you're seeing from an optimization standpoint that's impacting the spend profile of existing customers? And you made some reductions to storage costs at Current. So I'm wondering if that's something that all impacts customer spend and expectations in subsequent periods."}
{"doc_type": "earnings_call", "ticker": "CFLT", "period": "2023_Q3", "date": "2023-11-01", "section": "qa", "speaker": "Jay Kreps", "text": "Yes. I mean, customers continually optimize their environments. I would say what we're kind of reacting to more is making sure we get all the new projects, right? So if you think about two forces that are happening in cloud right now, one is more about optimization of existing usage. There's, of course, some of that in our customers at all times. But the other thing is just how many net new workloads are there. For a production system like ours, I think it's more about the new workloads than it is about optimization of environments. And so that's kind of where our focus is. When you think about what we're doing. It really is this consumption motion is really about making sure you land and attach to everything that's going on in the organization. And then, on the storage side, yes, similar to the enterprise clusters, these are efforts that are designed to accelerate consumption, particularly when you think about Flink and stream processing, it becomes important to not just process the data once, but if you change your logic, be able to go back and reprocess it again. So the incentive to want to store data becomes much higher in Confluent and we want to make sure that it doesn't become cost prohibitive as customers go after that. So in part, we're trying to set ourselves up for this preview release of Flink that we just did as that becomes GA. We want to have a cost structure that makes sense with the stream processing capabilities. And we think the result is going to be net positive in terms of how much data companies are storing."}

Just a follow-on, if I may, on the go-to-market changes you're making around consumption. Can you just help characterize how big or natural the change that is from the sales side?

{"doc_type": "earnings_call", "ticker": "CFLT", "period": "2023_Q3", "date": "2023-11-01", "section": "qa", "speaker": "Jay Kreps", "text": "Yes. It is a big change, right? So if you think about how an enterprise software company works, in this traditional model, everything really is organized around booking of commitments. That's what pipeline is. That's what the sales motion tracks. That's the line item in sales force. And you kind of are changing all that, where the thing you're going after is the use case, the thing that you're driving is consumption, the definition of pipeline is different. So there's a big change. Now it's not like the cloud transition we went through. That was a really big change. This is an adjustment that we're kind of factoring into the first half of the year. Our desire and the thing we're working towards is hit that as smoothly as possible. Like we're doing this because we think this is absolutely a positive, right? It's a thing that will allow us to grow faster. But when you make a bunch of changes all at once, you want to factor that in. You want to be prudent about how you do that, and that's why we've made the adjustment. This wasn't a new plan, like we're not doing this purely in a reactive way, where we got halfway through the year and we were like, oh, let's change everything. We had laid out a three-year plan for how we were going to do that. We were in year one. And we were going to do a little bit more next year and then a little bit more the year after. But realistically, when we just looked at what had happened to customer buying behavior, like how are customers behaving with regard to these consumption models and then how are we set up to work with them. We just realized, hey, this is not aligned. It does not make sense to slow roll it. We should just do it fast. Maybe it's a little bit more disruptive at the very beginning of the year, but I think you get to something net positive, much, much faster in that world. And it's -- in some sense, easier than having one leg on each horse for an extended period of time."}

Obviously, you have the visibility of RPO and CRPO, but in a world of consumption, it's always trying to predict what the customer is going to do. It's not ratable revenue. It's always it follows a curve, you need to predict what your customer needs to do. And how do companies solve it, they're essentially trying to do some predictive models by multiple factors, that predict that curve. In the new world, of course, what we are expecting and what we think is going to happen is the customer commitment is still going to be there, but they're not going to be committing ahead of time. They’re just going to be committing to your existing levels. So how do we get the predictability? As Jay alluded to, like -- we get the predictability by understanding what are the use cases they're going to drive. So the consumption transformation and all the work that we are going to do here will provide us, I'd say, added visibility into the work streams, which will help us predict revenue in a much better manner. And that's one of the reasons why I called out in my prepared remarks that going forward, subscription revenue will probably be a better indicator of the health of the business."}

Like if we work with a customer, we're trying to scope out every workload over the next two years and commit to lock that in. Of course, there's some predictability like in the two years, we know what the minimum they have to spend is. But if we're successful, they should be growing their consumption much faster than that curve anyway. And the effort of trying to really think of each application and how it's going to be used and exact usage pattern and all the uncertainty that pushes on to the customer is actually just really high. And so taking that more out of the equation and just having customers really do it in a customer-driven way where customer locks in the right level of commitment based on what they know they're doing, that's effectively what all the peer companies have done. It's worked very successfully for them. And that allows you to then really orient the go-to-market organization around finding those use cases rather than getting people that kind of pre-commit to them."}

One question on Flink in general. We have spoken to a lot of your partners. And it sounds like without Flink, and this is more of a high-level question, people are using Kafka streams on AWS with a Java-based application which is squaring into your Confluent clusters, right? That's a compute that is not being captured by Confluent today. I'm assuming Flink kind of allows you to capture those compute. But then we're also seeing AWS kind of coming up with their managed link service, right? I'm trying to understand Confluent being able -- now that you have -- you own the data persistence layer and the processing layer, as a whole, can you actually provide or offer something which is more than a point product Flink service that might be in the market?"}

The challenge in the streaming world has been for a long time, customers are left kind of piecing together the parts their own to build a data streaming platform. So you get Kafka and then maybe you add on some Flink thing, you get somewhere else -- and then the parts don't work together, like the security models are different. The governance and catalogs of data are different, it's all different. So it's kind of left as an exercise to the reader to put those things together. That's not the recipe for success, right? We think in this area, customers want to integrate it. So just in what we demonstrated at current already. I think we've taken an amazing steps. So unified security model across all of this, it handles all the connectivity. Unified model of data. If you go and create a new stream in Kafka, it's available there for you in Flink. You don't have to go and recreate it in Flink again. The ability to actually just seamlessly use these two together and do it without having to preallocate anything. You can go issue a query against your Kafka cluster. It will scale up and run that processing and scale back down to 0 cost if it finishes. So already, that integration is leaps and bounds further than anything that's been out there, I think, in the streaming world, integrating both the stream and the processing. And so if you think about, hey, what are our advantages in doing this, like stepping back to the question behind the question. I think the reason we feel like we have a lot of ability to succeed in this beyond any other competition. First of all, Flink is this platform that has been incredibly successful that everybody wants. Second, we have the ability to integrate that stream with the processing. And if you think about the model for data systems, that's just much easier. You could buy a database in parts where the query layer was separate from the storage engine, you can piece it together yourself, but that just doesn't seem like the winning formula. And it's obviously and very concretely a hassle today. And then finally, one of the things we're seeing is that people are thinking about this processing and streaming together, and that's moving upstream in organizations. And so, when we think about any competition in this space, most of it tends to come from different destination systems, but increasingly, the processing is kind of happening at the source and going out to all the destinations. So structurally, those are the three factors that we think give Confluent a unique advantage in this. Our expertise in Flink and just the fact that we have the core people driving that forward, the ability to combine it with Kafka, the kind of de facto standard for the stream and really provide synergy between those things. And then structurally, the fact that the processing of data is moving upstream to the source where the stream is created, which allows us to bring together that combination at the right time."}

{"doc_type": "earnings_call", "ticker": "CFLT", "period": "2023_Q3", "date": "2023-11-01", "section": "qa", "speaker": "Rohan Sivaram", "text": "Yes. Brad, that's a great question. And as I shared in the prepared remarks, there are a couple of headwinds heading into 2024 which we spoke about a couple of customers, macro and the consumption transformation. And as you think about the shape for next year, we feel that the consumption transformation will have a bigger impact from an adjustment perspective in the first half of the year than the second half of the year. So that's one data point. And I think Jay and I touched on it, exiting Q4 of next year, we'll have a few tailwinds, and I'll just reiterate a couple of them. The first one is the consumption transformation will be behind us. And what that means is how our customers want to consume confluence product and services will be very aligned with how we are going to market. So that's number 1. number 2, with respect to the product unlocks, of course, we'll have Flink which will be in GA, coupled with other unlocks on the DSP side, that's going to be FedRAMP exiting Q4 '24, and there's going to be tailwinds from AI. So overall, we feel that there are a decent amount of tailwinds exiting 2024, which gives us confidence that we'll get back to a 30%. It's just timing. We just want to get -- don't want to get into '25 guidance and specific timing, but that's a trajectory that we are thinking through."}

I mean, I think probably what's most exciting, big picture is actually just -- if anything, there's been an acceleration in interest in streaming. I would think about this in stages where this is a market that went from kind of very early nascent kind of evangelical to something that now just increasingly very senior people and organizations believe in and see happening and are trying to adjust to it and figuring out what does this mean for us and how do we take advantage of it? I mean, I think that's probably the biggest thing overall. In terms of our products, I love them all. That's why we're putting all the energy into it. That's why even in a year of a lot of efficiency, we really made sure that we had sufficient investment to bring together the rest of this data streaming platform, and we just weren't willing to cut that stuff. I think probably the biggest thing for us in terms of transformation of what we do is the Flink offering. I mean, that's what brings these application workloads directly into our platform, what makes it so much easier to build some of these things that actually capitalize on streaming to kind of run the logic of the business. In some sense, that's the most exciting, but they actually all play together. Without the connectors that get the data, you don't have the streams to process. Without the innovation in Kora, you don't have the ability to really handle the streaming data across a big organization. Without the governance stuff, it's actually just hard to use this and have correct guarantees around data and reason about it. So they all kind of play together to form the platform. So I think they're all kind of a powerful part of that story. And I think that story is why people are so excited about this space."}

What I was saying is if you look at the amount of kind of operating margin savings that companies are targeting, it's often a very large percent. I'm not saying that moving into a data center saves you 30%. I'm just saying, you're trying to say 3% operating margin improvement, you move some things around in a little small ways. 30%, you're going to do something big, right? For Confluent, we've made really substantial improvements that came out of a combination of growth, structural improvements, optimization of cloud, a whole bunch of things. But it was a bunch of moving parts to make it happen. If you look at other digital native companies, they're also doing big things. I think for 99.5% of companies moving into your data center going to be a lot more expensive. But that's up to them to model it out and figure it out. But I'm not saying that you'll see 30% savings from that. Does that make sense?"}

I guess, I feel like we hear about this every couple of year really. We heard about the Dropbox doing it. Every year, you hear about some example, companies selling private cloud stuff, put it on the front page of everything to make a big deal to how the cloud is over. That's not really what we see, like broadly, when we talk to our customer base, including the digital natives, I don't see a big movement there. I do think you see a lot more optimization of cloud, the usage of public cloud, that's certainly happening. But I don't see a big move out as being realistic. I just don't think it makes sense. But we'll see for us. We obviously sell across both cloud and on-premise. So to some extent, we're like a little bit agnostic. I personally as a technologist, just don't see it as a likely trend. I did this analysis internally when I worked at LinkedIn. I didn't think it made any sense. We were using the public cloud. Public cloud has gotten cheaper since that time. So I don't think it's likely, but obviously, either way, we're happy to work with the customers."}

So, yes, I don't think it's going to be that disruptive because we did start the process this year. So we're measuring consumption. There's a portion of compensation that's already dedicated to it. We've kind of taught our team a little bit of this. So, it's not like we haven't dipped our toes in the water, and that I think takes a lot of the risk out of it. We kind of know that people can be successful with us. So, that's kind of what gives us I guess, the confidence to jump in with both feet. I think realistically, if we were trying to do this from a cold start last year, I think it would have been quite disruptive and highly risky. I feel pretty good about what we're doing. Now, it's still a big change. It does mean that those primary metrics are all shifting and are kind of all shifting together. I think -- when I think about it from the team's point of view, I think it's actually exciting. I think people feel this friction today and how they're working with customers. I think doing the thing the customer wants is actually great when you're in a go-to-market organization. And if you look at the kind of growth in cloud revenue, we've done really well, right? The pressure has been on RPO. It has been on bookings. It has been on these kind of big upfront commitments. So, part of this is about making Confluent grow faster. Part of is also making sure our field team is really successful. And those two things kind of go together. So, yes, I actually think it's pretty exciting. And it's -- for a lot of people in go-to-market organizations, these consumption motion is kind of an opportunity. It's the new thing that's happening across a lot of these companies. If you kind of know that and have done it, you're kind of in a better position and what you're set up to do."}

And just looking ahead, of course, with this transformation and the one-off cases that we said, we expect the NRR probably to dip a little bit. It will still be above 120% as we go through next year. But exiting next year as we exit the transition, we expect that to -- the 125-plus percent range that we set from a medium-term code from an NRR perspective. So the health of the installed base is also very solid. That's something that I wanted to share."}

Steffan Tomlinson will be stepping down from his role as Confluent’s CFO and will be joining Stripe as their CFO. Rohan Sivaram has been named Confluent’s next Chief Financial Officer. Rohan is a seasoned finance and operations leader with nearly two decades of experience at leading companies across financial services, cybersecurity and data infrastructure. Rohan joined Confluent pre-IPO in 2020. He's been instrumental to the success of our organization across corporate finance, investor relations, treasury and business operations. Over the last three years, I've had the opportunity to work very closely with Rohan and could not be more excited to see him assuming this new role as our CFO. And Steffan, I wanted to take a moment to thank you for everything you've done for us. You've had an impact on every aspect of Confluent, including growing and scaling our operations, building a world class team and taking us through all nine quarters of earnings as a public company. Thank you and best of luck with your new role."}

Turning now to our Q2 results, total revenue grew 36% to $189 million. Confluent cloud revenue grew 78% to $84 million and non-GAAP operating margin improved 24 points. We have driven more than 30 points of margin improvements in the last 18 months and are well on our way to breakeven in Q4 this year. Achieving this sustained level of high growth despite ongoing market challenges underscores the mission critical nature of data streaming and reinforces our product leadership. In May, we hosted Kafka Summit London 2023. This year more than 1500 members of the community from over 50 countries joined us in person with greater than 2300 tuning in virtually. On our Q1 earnings call, we talked about the opportunity for monetizing Kafka and Confluent Cloud. This was emphasized at Kafka Summit with the unveiling of Kora, the next generation engine that powers Confluent Cloud. We shared with the audience some of the architectural elements that enable our cloud to drive a 10x advantage in performance while delivering a 60% TCO improvement. Our Kafka business has phenomenal growth ahead of it. Modern data architecture is increasingly centered around streaming and this has driven Kafka to be adopted by hundreds of thousands of organizations, including over 75% of the Fortune 500. This open source user base is growing rapidly and we are still in the early days of monetizing it. The inherent TCO and performance advantages of our cloud offering mean that in addition to the natural growth of this user base, we believe we can dramatically improve the proportion that is monetized as usage shifts to the cloud and can be captured by a managed service. If that were the extent of Confluent’s opportunity, that would be a very exciting prospect and enough to sustain our growth for many years but Kafka is just the start. In this call, I want to outline the evolution Confluent is driving in the streaming space and how we stand to benefit from it. This evolution is the rise of the data streaming platform. Kafka is the foundational layer in this platform but I outlined today the five key areas of capability that significantly extend the reach and value of streaming infrastructure and that we think are essential elements to the rise of data streaming platforms. The key capabilities of a DSP are the ability to stream, connect, govern, process and share. These capabilities capture the full life cycle of streaming data, how to get it, process it, use it, manage it and share it between systems. Kafka is the stream of data. It allows companies to produce and consume real time streams of data at any scale with strong guarantees on the delivery of data. It is the foundational hub of data exchange in a modern data architecture and today it comprises the substantial majority of our Confluent cloud revenue. But these other capabilities are not mere add-ons. They are essential components of the emerging platform and represent significant opportunities for monetization for Confluent that are still early in their realization. I'll walk through each of these capabilities. Discuss the evidence that each is growing into a broadly adopted portion of the DSP and talk about how Confluent is adding these capabilities to Confluent Cloud. Our Kafka business and Confluent Cloud is growing very fast, but even today these non-Kafka components are growing even faster. Over time, we expect these capabilities to drive the majority of our cloud revenue even as they help to accelerate the use of Kafka as the underlying strength. Let's start with connectors. Connectors may seem mundane, but they are in fact a key capability. Indeed, many ETL and integration products differentiate in large part on their pool of connectors. They are central to our vision as well. To build a central nervous system for your business you have to be able to connect all of your systems to capture the real time streams of data. Confluent Cloud makes it possible to run any Kafka connector in a cloud native way, making them serverless, elastically scalable and fault tolerant. This has driven the development of over 120 connectors created and owned by Confluent to some of the most common enterprise systems. However, the ecosystem of connectors is far larger than just these. There are many hundreds of open source connectors to less common systems that are available. We are still early in monetizing this area in Confluent Cloud as fully unlocking it requires ease of use across cloud networking layers and disparate data and SAS systems. We took a major step towards this in Q2 with the release of our custom connectors offering, which allows running any open source connector inside Confluent Cloud, expanding our reach beyond the set of connectors we ship with out-of-the-box. We believe this is still in the early phases of full unlock. On premise in our Confluent platform product Connect has approximately an 80% adoption rate. But we are still in the early days of ramping that level of usage in our fully managed offering Confluent Cloud. As data streaming use cases grow and real time data flows across internal systems and applications it's critical that users can discover, monitor and reason about the security and integrity of that data. You need to control who has access to the data to find how that data is allowed to evolve and visualize and monitor where it ultimately goes. Creating a central nervous system for data is only possible if you can stream data safely. What do these governance concerns have to do with streaming, you might ask? Well, it turns out that governance concerns come into play precisely when data moves between systems, when it's exchanged between teams or is transported between Regents, or as processed from one form to another. In other words, data governance needs arise directly from the primary use of data streaming. Because Confluent handles this movement and processing, we are uniquely positioned to directly integrate governance of that movement automatically and seamlessly in a way that no other vendor can with a bolt on product. This is the role of stream governance, one of our first moves up the stack and a large product opportunity for Confluent. Stream Governance is our fully managed governance suite that delivers a simple self-service experience for customers to discover, trust and understand how data flows across their business. We have taken a freemium approach to stream governance giving basic functionalities to every customer and more recently, starting to monetize with our Stream Governance Advanced offering. Two thirds of our Confluent Cloud customers are using Stream Governance today and revenue growth from Stream Governance Advanced is the fastest of any product we've launched today. The next area of the DSP is Stream Processing. This is an easy one to understand. Data processing is a key component of any major data platform and SQL and other processing layers are a key component of modern databases. Stream Processing extends these processing capabilities to real time data streams. We believe that Apache Flink is emerging as the de facto standard for stream processing. Flink has the most powerful implementation of stream processing of any technology, open source or proprietary, fully realizing streaming as a generalization of batch processing and making it available across a rich ecosystem of programming languages and interfaces. It is widely popular in the open source community and is used by some of the most technically sophisticated companies in the world, including Apple, Capital One, Netflix, Stripe, and Uber. We've discussed the criticality of Stream Processing to our strategy in the past. The easiest way to understand the potential in this area is to understand that for each stream in Confluent Cloud today, there's likely to be some application code processing or reacting to that stream of data.  That application code represents complex software engineering and the opportunity for Flink from the customer's point of view is to simplify that development effort, from Confluence point of view this allows us to monetize not just the data, but the application itself while helping the customer to realize efficiencies in both the development and operational costs that are possible with the cloud native stream processing layer. We took a major step forward on our Flink strategy this last quarter when we announced the early access program at Kafka Summit, opening up this offering to the first customers who are now actively using the platform. Early feedback is very encouraging with particular enthusiasm for the direct integration into the other capabilities of Confluent Cloud. For customers, this means their streams of data in Kafka are automatically available for processing in Flink’s SQL and that everything works together with the shared model of governance and security. We're incredibly excited about this product and look forward to its broad availability later this year. The final capability is about making it easy to share data streams. Sharing within a company has been a mainstay of our platform for some time. However, now we have extended that between companies with a feature we just launched at Kafka Summit, Stream Sharing. This intercompany sharing is a pattern we noticed was gaining startling traction in our customer base in recent years. Customers in financial services and insurance needed to integrate and provide key financial data streams with a complex set of providers. Customers in travel needed to exchange real time data on flights between airports, airlines, bookings companies and baggage handling companies. Retailers and manufacturers had to ingest real time streams from suppliers to manage an end-to-end view of their inventory or supply chain. Oftentimes these companies would have teams working out complex systems to mediate this sharing, only to realize on further discussion that on both sides the foundational layer that they were opening up was the same. It was Kafka. Stream Sharing allows these companies to enable this inter organizational sharing for any of their existing streams and to do so in a way that enables the same governance and security capabilities that they'd use internally with added capabilities to address the additional concerns of allowing access from external parties. This means extending our central nervous system vision for something that spans a company to something that spans large portions of the digital economy. By doing this the natural network effect of streaming where streams attract apps which in turn attract more Streams is extended beyond a single company, helping to drive the acquisition of new customers as well as the growth within existing customers. It's essential to understand that these five capabilities stream, connect, govern, process share, are not only additional things to sell, they are all part of a unified platform and the success of each drives additional success in the others. The connectors make it easier to get data streams into Kafka, which accelerates not just our core Kafka business, but also opens up more data for processing in Flink, adds to the set of streams governed by Stream Governance where they're shareable by Stream Sharing. Applications built with Flink drive use of connectors for data acquisition and read and write their inputs from Kafka. Governance and sharing add to the value proposition for each stream added to the DSP. Each of these capabilities strengthens the other four. The full value of this will not be realized overnight. Cloud infrastructure takes time to mature and reach completion. Each of these areas is earlier in the S curve of maturity and adoption than Kafka, but over time, we think these will directly contribute revenue larger than Kafka itself in addition to driving further consumption of Kafka. Most importantly is what these capabilities let our customers do. As these parts come together, they comprise a data platform that is as complete as data warehouses, data lakes or databases have grown to be over the years. We think this data streaming platform will be of equal size and importance to these other platforms serving as the fundamental nervous system for a modern company. This complete platform resonates with companies of all sizes, industries and geographies serving an endless number of use cases. One segment of our customer base that has been under particular pressure in this macro environment is digital native tech companies who are under increasing pressure to drive new efficiencies. But this is also a high performing segment of our business, a testament to our execution and the TCL advantages of our platform. This includes customers like Instacart, Netflix, Plat and Square. We are seeing particularly strong traction in this segment in India, including customers like Meesho. Meesho is a high growth Indian e-commerce company who last year was one of the most downloaded shopping apps in the world. It was the fastest shopping app to cross 500 million downloads and regularly sees huge traffic spikes that see over 1,000,000 requests per second. Kafka is used broadly across Meesho's business including its real time recommendation engine to deliver great user experience for customers and sellers. But manually configuring and tuning open source Kafka wasn't aligned with their overall push for sustainable solutions and driving business efficiencies. So they migrated to Confluent Cloud. Confluent now processes its shopping transactions and is a key part of the architecture that delivers exceptional experiences for its buyers and sellers. Policy Genius is an online insurance marketplace that covers more than 30 million customers and their life, disability, home and auto insurance needs. Today's customers demand real time in all aspects of their life, even when shopping for insurance. By combining modern tech with real agents, Policy Genius delivers quotes from leading insurance companies side by side in minutes and helps customers through the selection and purchasing process. Initially, they relied on the competitors Kafka compatible data streaming technology to stream policy information to their agents, but they found themselves spending too much supporting the platform and were caught off guard by surprise costs. And as they look to expand use cases, they needed a more complete data streaming platform they could grow alongside them. After two months trialing Confluent as a pay-as-you-go customer, they went all in on Confluent Cloud in Q2. With Confluent Cloud, Policy Genius can save money while helping their customers feel good about finding the right insurance online. Recursion Pharmaceuticals is a leading biotech company that uses advancements in AI and biology to accelerate and industrialize the discovery of new drugs. Traditional drug discovery is often slow and expensive, relying on manual bespoke processes and experiments influenced by human bias. Recursion, on the other hand, runs over 2 million experiments per week to generate a massive biological and chemical data set to train machine learning models that discover new insights beyond what is known in scientific literature. Confluent is the backbone stream infrastructure for experimental data that feeds their AI models, with more than 23 petabytes of real time biological and chemical data improving the predictions of the models. This approach rapidly accelerates the time it takes to discover and develop drugs, and ultimately as how they improve the lives of patients all around the world. In closing, I'm pleased with our strong second quarter results. Our results show that data streaming has emerged as a mission critical component of the modern data stack and our rapid pace of product innovation puts us in an excellent position to continue capturing more of this $60 billion market opportunity. With that, I'll turn the call over to Steffan to walk through our financials one last time."}
{"doc_type": "earnings_call", "ticker": "CFLT", "period": "2023_Q2", "date": "2023-08-02", "section": "prepared", "speaker": "Steffan Tomlinson", "text": "Thanks, Jay. We delivered another strong quarter beating our guidance on all metrics. Key highlights for the second quarter include robust top line growth, strong customer expansion and substantial margin improvements. These results underscore our leadership position in a $60 billion data streaming market and our team's track record of driving durable and efficient growth. Turning now to the results, RPO for the second quarter was $791.4 million, up 34%. Current RPO, estimated to be 65% of RPO, was $514.8 million, up 41%. Our growth rates in RPO, while healthy were impacted by a continuation of lower average deal sizes, a result of customer scrutinizing their budgets in the current environment. Despite the budget scrutiny, we remain encouraged that customers continue to derive value from using Confluent and consume more than their commitments, which is reflected in our revenue but not in our RPO results. In Q2, we added 140 net new customers, ending the quarter with approximately 4830 customers, up 17%. The growth in our large customer base remained robust, driven by continued expansion of use cases. We added 69 customers with 100K or more in ARR, bringing the total to 1144 customers up 33%. These large customers contributed more than 85% of total revenue in the quarter. We also added 12 customers with $1,000,000 or more in ARR, bringing the total to 147 customers, up 48%. And our $5 million plus cohort continued to grow. Our expansion momentum shows that Confluent is the platform of choice for data streaming from early stage adoption to cross company standardization and ultimately the central nervous system of our customers’ modern tech stack. For Q2 and NRR was above 130% in GRR was above 90%, NRR for Cloud was above 140%, reflecting the power of the industry's only cloud native platform made possible with Quora. Turning to the P&L, total revenue grew 36% to $189.3 million. Subscription revenue was very strong and grew 39% to $176.5 million and accounted for 93% of total revenue. Within subscription, Confluent platform grew 16% to $92.9 million, exceeding our expectations and accounted for 49% of total revenue. Q2 marks the second quarter this year in which Confluent Platform overperformed relative to expectations. It was driven by strength in regulated industries such as public sector and financial services. These industries are still in the early stages of moving workloads to the cloud, but have a high demand for on-prem data streaming. Confluent Cloud revenue grew 78% to $83.6 million. We guided sequential revenue growth of $7.5 million to $8 million for Q2. The actual sequential increase came in at $9.9 million, exceeding the midpoint of our guidance range by $2.2 million and it was driven primarily by higher than expected consumption from select customers. From a product mix standpoint, cloud revenue accounted for 44% of revenue compared to 34% of revenue a year ago and cloud as a percentage of new ACV, bookings exceeded 50% for the 7th consecutive quarter. Turning to the geographic mix of revenue, revenue from the U.S. grew 30% to $113.9 million, revenue from outside the U.S. grew 45% to $75.4 million. Moving to the rest of the income statement, I'll be referring to non-GAAP results unless stated otherwise. Total gross margin was 75%, up 440 basis points and above our FY23 target range of 72% to 73%. Subscription gross margin was 79.1%, up 230 basis points, gross margin outperformance was driven by our strong Confluent platform margin that continued improvement in efficiency, optimization of underlying hardware profile and increase multi tenancy and Quora, our core Kafka engine and Confluent Cloud. Turning to profitability and cash flow, operating margin improved 24 percentage points and negative 9.2%, representing our 4th consecutive quarter of more than 10 points in improvement. Q2 operating margin was driven by subscription revenue outperformance and our continued focus on driving efficiency across the company. We drove improvement in every category of our operating expenses with the most pronounced progress made again in sales and marketing improving 14 percentage points and we're pleased to achieve $0.00 net income per share in Q2.  We've included all related shares, outstanding amounts used to calculate historical and guided net loss or income per share and our earnings presentation on our website. Free cash flow margin improved 8 percentage points to negative 18.6%. We ended the second quarter with $1.85 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. Now turning to our outlook, I'd like to provide context on how our approach to guidance continues to evolve in response to what we're seeing in the business environment. At the beginning of the year, we prudently took into consideration and have been navigating the tough selling environment and the macro related factors of additional budget scrutiny and changes in customer buying behavior, both of which have led to sales cycle elongation. We've learned through the first half of this year that customers are more inclined to sign shorter duration contracts, start with smaller initial deal sizes and are okay consuming more than their committed contracts, which has been reflected in our results. Our point of view is the choppy macro environment we've seen will continue throughout the remainder of the year. Even with these macro dynamics at play, our data streaming platform continues to grow at outsized rates. Our subscription revenue growth of 39% in Q2 tells the story. From a product mix standpoint, Confluent platform, which is prevalent and regulated industries has overperformed relative to our expectations. We expect Confluent Platform to continue to perform well in the second-half, trending above the expectations we had at the beginning of the year. Our cloud business continues to be a bright spot given the high net retention rates, product market fit, strong TCO and ROI it delivers to customers. We expect cloud to continue to grow at a substantially higher rate than the rest of the business in the second-half. We'll continue to monitor the signals of our business and proactively manage the rate and pace of investments. If the macro sentiment improves, we'd expect to benefit from that, but it's too soon to call. Moving on to our guidance, I'm pleased to share that we're raising total revenue, gross margin, operating margin and EPS for both the quarter and the year. For the third quarter of 2023, we expect revenue to be in the range of $193.5 million to $195.5 million, representing growth of 28% to 29%. Cloud revenue to be approximately $92.2 million, representing growth of 62% and accounting for approximately 47% of total revenue based on the midpoint of our guide. Implied in that is a sequential revenue add of approximately $8.5 million which is above our prior quarter guidance range of $7.5 million to $8 million for Q2 23. Non-GAAP operating margin to be approximately negative 10% and non-GAAP net loss or income per share to be in the range of negative $0.1 to $0.00. For the full year 2023, we expect revenue to be in the range of $767 million to $772 million representing growth of 31% to 32%. Non-GAAP operating margin to be approximately negative 10% and non-GAAPp net loss per share in the range of negative $0.5 to negative $0.2 cents. Additionally, we're raising our FY23 target range for non-GAAP gross margin to approximately 74% for Q 4 2024 targets we continue to expect to land within the range of 48% to 50% for cloud as percentage of total revenue, but likely at the lower end due to the factors we called out before and the strength in our Confluent platform business impacting product mix shift. And we continue to expect to achieve break even for non-GAAP operating margin. The timing of free cash flow margin break even will roughly mirror that of our operating margin. In closing, I'm pleased with the continued momentum we see across Confluent Platform and Confluent Cloud. Our market leading data streaming platform is winning and we're continuing to execute well in a choppy macro environment. Looking forward, we're well positioned to drive durable and efficient growth. Now Jay, Rohan and I will take your questions."}

You really do have the Midas touch, with your job choices, but my question is on the consumption side. Confluent Cloud has been out for a few years now. Are you seeing a trend where customers are over consuming more than they previously had and you talked about kind of the annual commitments that they're making, are they tending to make lower annual commitments because of the economy and therefore overconsume more and then how does that manifest in the numbers?"}
{"doc_type": "earnings_call", "ticker": "CFLT", "period": "2023_Q2", "date": "2023-08-02", "section": "qa", "speaker": "Steffan Tomlinson", "text": "Yes that's a great question and that dynamic is present. I would attribute it to two facts, internally we have been really shifting our go-to market to emphasize driving consumption, more use cases coming on to the platform as quickly as possible even outside of the term of new commitments. And then externally, yes, there's real market pressure and so companies are being very thoughtful about how, what they commit to up front, how much they pay ahead et cetera, and so, both those dynamics are present and that is reflected in a really strong consumption results. I think it's ultimately healthy. This is kind of the intention of these consumption models that's certainly how we treat consumption vendors internally. But it does show up you know when you look at the kind of RPO, CRPO split and RPO versus kind of revenue performance for Confluent Cloud."}

I apologize the video operator seems to be not too kind on my side, but quick question just on Cloud, obviously a big point of focus came in strong in Q2, just wondering if you can add commentary on the progression you saw during the quarter, visibility you have into rest of the year as a result and then it looked like 3Q guidance is now sequentially down a touch as of starting point versus where Q2 came in. Was there anything unexpected that came through in Q2 or maybe just help us think through the progression of what you're expecting to see on Cloud from here? Thanks."}

I would say particularly set a larger customers drove kind of over performance there. We didn't think that that indicated necessarily equal over performance on each subsequent quarter.

The only other thing I'd add is at the beginning of the year we had called for sequential increases in Cloud revenue and we've been delivering that in Q1 and Q2. We had guided $7.5 million to $8 million for Q2 and we came in $2.2 million above the midpoint of the range and so when you when you take out a little bit of that over performance and you look at our guide for Q3 that will, that is a sequential increase relative to our original guide in Q2. So the underlying strength and drivers of the cloud business very strong and we are seeing adoption across cohorts and we're seeing very good adoption in the marketplace."}

I mean, there there's kind of two things going on under the covers. On one hand, is the percentage that is Confluent Cloud has gone up and of course Confluent Cloud being you know a managed service has a lower gross margin than Confluent platform which is pure software. At the same time Confluent Cloud gross margin has been rapidly improving and that's due to a number of factors, but in particular the improvements in Kora, more emphasis on the multi tenancy and the system, improvements in the underlying hardware profile that we use, improvements in the software stack really top to bottoms [indiscernible] drive efficiency. And so we're very excited by the progress there. I don't know if you want to add anything to that Steffan?"}

Steffan will definitely miss you and Rohan, huge congratulations. Great to watch your career trajectory over the past several years. So one for you Jay, when you look at-- we thought we're going to have a recession this year and looks like we've dodged one. If the economic conditions do stabilize, how do you see Confluent Cloud versus Platform, not to make it one versus the other, both the great products, but when customers start to get back to priorities, do you think we'll get back to a more platform upside or rather a Cloud upside because in this downturn I think the on-prem component of many software companies that have hybrid business models has taken a little bit more precedence, I don't know why and the Cloud adoption generally has slowed a bit. Do you think that- we go back to clouded option if the economic conditions do stabilize and one for you Steffan if I could, when we look at the cloud business the use cases, are you getting basically identical use cases as to the on Prem or are you seeing a new set of use cases that really is pulling away the Cloud momentum in a different direction? Maybe it's a different set of customers and a different set of industries, some set of use cases or different geographies? I'll take this opportunity to ask you a bit of a technical question because we're going to miss you in a couple of months. So, anyway, I'll throw that out."}
{"doc_type": "earnings_call", "ticker": "CFLT", "period": "2023_Q2", "date": "2023-08-02", "section": "qa", "speaker": "Jay Kreps", "text": "Yes put them to the test on the way out. I think that's fair. Yes it's a, it's a great question, Kash. So yes, I mean it's a little bit speculative. I do think that you're on to something there though. What we have seen is two behaviors, one I already alluded to which is this very strong consumption relative to commit. So people just being thoughtful about commits, but then actually using more than more than they had committed to. I do think there's also a set of customers that are being a bit, little bit more thoughtful about the pace of their cloud migration. So I've heard of people pulling back entirely. We haven't seen that in our customer base like people are moving to the cloud, but they're kind of trying to get the last dollar out of their on premise environments, thoughtful about which workload moves in when, a little bit more hesitant to have parallel spend. And you know the result of that has, I think has driven some of the success of Confluent Platform in addition to the public sector thing which we alluded to. It's not a bad thing for us. You know it is our strategy to be able to span all these environments and connect them and we think that strength in OneDrive, strengthen the other and so we're happy to serve the customers in the environment that they're using. That’s very much our approach on the product side. But I do suspect that yes, were we to see kind of an acceleration and a little bit of a loosening of the purse strings and the IT budgets. I do think you'd see a little bit faster push in the Cloud and if that speculation were correct then that would probably drive our Cloud business further."}

And as it relates to the second question, just around use cases, there's the traditional set of use cases that we've talked about a lot, but I'd like to just focus a moment on some of the Gen AI, AI and ML use cases that we're seeing. Customers are really starting to do and have been doing a number of things. First is, they're building real time context data and using that to power chat interfaces with their customers. You've seen them also provide product recommendations based off of demographics and buying patterns. And then we've also seen technology that deploys AI assistance to drivers and helping with fleet logistics. And then finally, I would say customers are also building a real time ML and data science pipeline to power their new fraud detection platform. So there are lots of use cases that companies have already been using our technology for, but then with the all the advances that are being made, they're going to be using our technology even more so in the future."}

So yes, I would say generally our expansion is driven by, either new use cases or conversion of existing use cases that are using the open source.

On net, I don't know the businesses are just getting bigger at a large rate year-over-year. The other area of expansion is the new product capabilities that we're adding. We have a consumption model as those layers on customers can kind of in a very frictionless way use more of that. For Confluent Cloud thus far it has been kind of largely driven by Kafka, but we are expecting over time some of those other components to drive. So those are those are kind of the three vectors expansion in the use of capabilities, expansion in the kind of raw volume of data and expansion and use cases today the spread of use cases is definitely the one that drives is."}

Nice quarter and Congrats Steffan, we'll miss you at Confluent, but I couldn't think of a better, more capable successor than Rohan. So Congrats to you Rohan, really excited to see you in the new role. Jay, on stream processing. It's good to hear the encouraging early feedback and in particular around the integration points with the rest of your platform you talked about still being in the early stages of S curve adoption. I want to make sure nothing's changed in terms of the timeline and impact that you initially expected when you did the deal. And if you can remind us of any milestones we should look for in the years ahead to appraise your progress, with Flink?"}

To go from kind of a standing start to having you know a real like Cloud stream processing layer that customers can use is a big deal. It's currently in early access, meaning it's being used by a handful of customers, we're working with them, getting feedback. It'll go into you know kind of open availability and then GA and those are kind of the milestones to expect from us. In GA is when it will start to take on production workloads. But to be clear, you know with any cloud infrastructure there is a longer ramp as you kind of reach the full completion of feature sets are available across every cloud with every networking type that will continue. And then of course customers have to ramp their spend to the point where it moves Confluent’s numbers overall and that will happen use case at a time. And so, a certain amount of patience is important in these areas. This is what we saw with our Kafka business where at first it was a small thing in the cloud and then as we really hit that kind of the right point on that maturity curve, it ramped much faster. I think we can do that a little bit quicker with some of these additional components because they are a natural attached to Kafka, but there still is a curve that ramps and so, yes, to your question, we're exactly on the schedule that we originally intended which is kind of amazing for such a complicated software project. We're really pleased with how the team is integrated and I think the product we built is even better than I imagine. So I'm very excited about it, but yes, it will ramp you know over the course of next year and really kind of contribute most meaningfully in 25."}

And if I could just ask a follow up and something that I get asked about from investors. One of your smaller private competitors completed a Series C capital raise recently and I've just seen many markets where you have a venture backed player that can come, can enter and maybe more easily afford to operate at a loss and pressure price. Any thoughts or updates competitively and is this something that you worry about and that you face in the market? Thanks."}
{"doc_type": "earnings_call", "ticker": "CFLT", "period": "2023_Q2", "date": "2023-08-02", "section": "qa", "speaker": "Jay Kreps", "text": "Yeah, you're probably talking about Red, Red Panda. Yes we pay attention to any of the earlier competitors. We've had a sequence of those almost since the company started, Pulsar was the thing for a while and then kind of went away. There's been other systems before that, so we pay attention to all of them. We compete very effectively with them even one of the customer stories today was actually a customer of theirs that was one of their reference customers that’s now customer of ours. And so, we feel good about that setup. Overall, if you look at what's happening in the space that we're in, there's two big trends that I think actually make it hard for really any competitor, but particularly a smaller competitor. The first is this movement to the cloud and the expectation on a true cloud native service, right, which is a really serious investment to build something like that. The second is the broadening of this space from kind of just Kafka to a full data streaming platform, like the full set of capabilities, kind of think of it as going from word versus word perfect to Microsoft Office, right? And you know if you look at those two trends, they're just very strongly prevalent in the world and they're actually hard for competitors to do, hard for some of the cloud players to do for a whole set of reasons, particularly hard for a smaller startup to do. You know I think we're actually lucky to be at the scale to be able to sustain the investment to do both of those things right and kind of drive that progress forward and I think it's exactly where this space is going and so that's the bet that we've got and I think that sets us up well against the full spectrum of the competitive landscape."}

Jay, appreciate the commentary around patience with regard to stream processing and budgets.

{"doc_type": "earnings_call", "ticker": "CFLT", "period": "2023_Q2", "date": "2023-08-02", "section": "qa", "speaker": "Jay Kreps", "text": "Yes. Yes, there there's kind of two patterns for adoption for US1 is. The net new use case of which there's plenty happening even in a tighter economy. You know, Kafka open source adoption continues at pace and many, many use cases for that are actually just coming and directly starting on our cloud. That will be true for Flink and some of these other components as well. And then the conversions and the conversion, you know, it depends, you know the kind of bigger the setup that a company has, the more complicated that is, but they often move it a bit at a time. And so you know, we don't have to kind of eat the apple all in one bite. And so yes, that that time frame depends there. There's companies that are very disciplined. That can move actually a very large setup, you know in a couple months even though there may be hundreds of applications, there's other you know, areas where that will take longer. It really depends on the setup with customers. The nice thing about these additional DSP components the rest of the data streaming platforms is it has a very strong attach to Kafka And so the initial adoption need not be you know, new customers coming from the streets. It need not even be new use cases. It can kind of drive direct attach off what you're doing already with Kafka. And so it kind of pulls in and starts with our existing customers and the nature of these consumption models. You know this is their biggest strength, right there's obviously a ton of complexity with consumption.  You know it's very friendly to the customers and customers like it especially in this kind of environment. But one of the superpowers that I think AWS really proved is that ability to expand in a low friction way to other components. And particularly in the streaming space where the core stream of data is the thing that everything else hooks on to, it's the thing you need governance for, it's the thing that connectors produce, it's the thing that the Flink is processing that kind of draws in those other components. And so that's the first target for us is get that attach rate with the existing customer base up before we're kind of going out and trying to convert existing Flink users."}

Our pipeline, we had a really strong pipeline quarter last quarter, which is a good leading indicator. And we also are measuring a number of sign-ups that we have for our pay-as-you-go business. And those continue to be robust. But as we've mentioned over the last three or four earnings calls, the progression of stages from top of funnel, all the way through committed contracts and then ultimately through expansion, et cetera. just some of that business has just slowed down, and we've been factoring that into how we not only forecast our business on the top line, but we've also been making operational changes around how we're investing in the business. And we come at this from the lens of ensuring that we're driving that top line growth as high as we can, but also delivering the profitability that we've communicated in the street, and we've been able to do that. So, the top of funnel metrics actually looked pretty good, but it's -- we're trying to increase the deal velocity and the conversion rates and those are the things that our team has been working on. And I think about it like what Erica and Stephanie and Jay and other folks in the organization are spending their time on it, it's the conversion rates, it's the deal velocity, and we're making progress there. And as I also mentioned in the prepared remarks, to the extent that the economy improves, we should benefit from that just like other companies would. But in the meantime, it's like we're navigating through and ensuring that we're delivering on our commitments."}

How are you expecting that this is going to evolve?"}
{"doc_type": "earnings_call", "ticker": "CFLT", "period": "2023_Q2", "date": "2023-08-02", "section": "qa", "speaker": "Jay Kreps", "text": "Yes. That's probably the hardest one to forecast. What was shocking to me was how prevalent this pattern had become and how much work it was for customers to do it. So despite the fact they were doing a lot of this by hand with kind of custom code, they were writing, they- just across every industry that seems to be popping up. And that was what made us really feel strongly enough that we needed to invest in productizing it, even in a time period where we're operating relatively leanly. The opportunity is really to drive the spread. And so if you see what happens in a lot of these industries is there's a whole ecosystem of data flow. And once the mechanism for that gets set up, it really doesn't change and tends to drive any new entrant or provider or spire that taps into that to also adopt the same layer. And that kind of network effect, that's certainly something we would see within a company as we spin up and get to scale. At a certain point of time, you have to ask for permission not to use Confluent instead of two years Confluent. That's obviously a really good point to get to. Being able to do that within an industry or within a sector is even better because that can drive the acquisition of new customers. And that to me is the thing I'm most excited about, more so than the kind of direct monetization, which is obviously an opportunity as well but that ability to kind of become a standard for the exchange of data in different sectors and industries."}

And I'll pass on my comments, too, Steffan, we'll miss working with you, but congratulations to Rohan in stepping up to the CFO role here. Two questions, first, on the cloud guidance that we have today for Q3, I think in the prepared remarks, management alluded to maybe a smaller set of customers who drove some of that 2Q outperformance and that's why we're seeing the incremental revenue growth in Confluent Cloud declining in Q3 versus Q2. Again, the incremental growth it’s still growing, but it's at a lower pace versus what we saw in 2Q. So my question is really, can you help us think about the volume of those customers that drove that Q2 outperformance and anything else that you can allude to, whether it's a particular vertical or what a specific use case or maybe more onetime in scope that drove that sizable beat that we're looking at in Q2 here, just for context, when we think about how it's flowing through in Q3?"}

There was a set of customers that drove a portion of that we alluded to different events in each case, but yes, some streaming services that we’re kind of ramping up large sporting event in the Asia Pacific that was bringing stuff online. So there's a bunch of different factors that kind of led to a ramp-up that we didn't think necessarily made sense to project forward an alternative, but we thought it was a great uptick in the business."}

And then one, if I could ask over to Steffan here. But on the guidance, for the negative 10% operating margin guidance that we have for Q3, the slight erosion versus what we just saw in Q2. And I'm just trying to sanity check that. Were there any delays in expenses that may be pushed from Q2 to Q3 or can you help us think through why we are looking at a wider operating loss when thinking about that margin in Q3 versus what we just saw out of the June quarter?"}

I mean there's -- what we're talking about is effectively roughly flat quarter-on-quarter and way better than what we had originally thought for in Q3. So what we have going on is there's some -- we look at the top line growth, we look at margin and we look at the key drivers as we construct the overall guidance. And there was nothing that was pulled forward or pushed out in Q2. We are just forecasting where our head counts is going to land, timing of head count, and so it's effectively flat quarter-on-quarter. And way better than what we thought at the beginning of the year relative to where we thought operating margin would be in Q3. And we also raised numbers for Q4 profit as well. So overall -- or for the full year, I should say, so we’ll always feel good about that."}

That has been an area of investment and kind of increased focus for us maybe in the last six-nine months. And it's actually manifested in some pretty positive early signs a couple of ways. So, a couple of the SIs where we've seen really strong traction and we think if that continues, that can be a substantial tailwind over time. We've seen this actually reflected in the uptick in pipeline that Steffan called out, that was an area that was a little behind our expectations, maybe a year ago. It is now performing above plan now, which has been really a kind of strong turnaround in the area and so we were really happy to see. So yes, I think both of those are positive signs and of course, kind of key discussions in the technology landscape. We announced a program around the technology partners, and this is an area that I think it's particularly strategic, making sure that we have the integrations into all these different systems, either upstream or downstream that want to plug in, deliver streams of data out to everything else in an organization or pull it in and do some kind of analytics or AI or machine learning on top of it, that's a program that we've launched that has really seen strong demand, and I think is very exciting."}

One more, if I may, please, when we think of the success you've had over the years, a lot of this is driven by need for real-time streaming in next-generation applications. But I know there's also a good mix of deals here that involve modernization of existing data platforms and providing that real-time capability to a lot of legacy applications. So, just curious, any observation there on that mix of deal activity coming from net new activity versus replacement and refresh modernization of existing infrastructure? Thank you."}
{"doc_type": "earnings_call", "ticker": "CFLT", "period": "2023_Q2", "date": "2023-08-02", "section": "qa", "speaker": "Jay Kreps", "text": "Yes. There's -- that's exactly right, that our business has always been a mixture of connecting into the old and connecting into the new. And I actually think it's kind of one of the secrets of our success. When you think about a lot of new technologies, the message behind it is ultimately like, hey, if you delete all the things that you built over the years and rebuild it with us, it will be better, right? And the reality is it's just not that practical for a large organization that's running some major part of the economy on software they built over 30 years to delete it, rebuild it. And so the really cool thing about data streaming and complement is it's about how do you connect into all the old things, the mainframes and relational databases and on-premise systems. But then also how do you open that up and really create the backbone for the architecture that you want to have, the new applications, the new systems, the things that are driving customer interaction, and the things that are helping you run the business more effectively and that's kind of proven out. You would see that in our adoption, the kind of digital native customers repeated some of them. They're starting from scratch. There's no mainframe offload project there, this is the architecture that they want to have. But you would also see in our customers, these very traditional organizations that have been around for decades or more and have built up software estates over that time. And so yes, I think with a little pressure on the economy, you probably see somewhat fewer of the kind of net new applications. But in many ways, that’s kind of hook into the systems that you have, the push on modernization for the sake of efficiency becomes more important. And those are all use cases that be feed."}

It was talked about in the prepared remarks that there's still some macro choppiness out there. Two questions and you can tackle them however you like. First, maybe expanding on some of the things that were already said, what changes have you made from a go-to-market standpoint over the last couple of quarters and adjusting to macro? And how has that impacted the pipeline and top funnel today? And then separately, when you look across your customer verticals and customers by geography, are there any material changes you've seen, either positive or negative in terms of consumption over the last quarter?"}
{"doc_type": "earnings_call", "ticker": "CFLT", "period": "2023_Q2", "date": "2023-08-02", "section": "qa", "speaker": "Jay Kreps", "text": "Yes. To the first question in terms of what changes have we made, it's probably too long of a list to go through. I mean, just in great detail, I think we went through virtually every aspect of the go-to-market and looked at, hey, what's the efficiency of marketing spend?, what are the customer targets that are most likely to convert?, what's holding up in this market? How are we presenting TCO analysis and showing the value of our offering? And how are we doing that not just for new deals? But for customers we already have to make sure that they feel very confident in the investment that they've made and that they're comfortable with future expansion. That list goes on and on and on. So that's been a very significant effort. I think, any kind of economic pressure shows in really clear relief where there's gaps. And in a way, that's good. It actually lets us improve and get better. To some extent, you're kind of learning to swim faster because you're swimming against the stream. And so I think that has been a healthy thing for the company versus an environment a few years back where there was a certain tailwind and all kinds of things worked that maybe shouldn't. Looking at sectors and parts of the economy we've seen, which is interesting, pretty strong trends in EMEA and APAC. That's been positive. One of the things we touched on in this call was our commercial business has done really well through this. They've had to adapt, they have a pretty strong chunk of the tech companies, both maybe kind of newly public, private, that are under pressure. And so they've really adjusted kind of how they serve that market, but they've continued to show success, which I think is really promising. So those are a few of the things that we've noticed. There's always some kind of shift industry to industry, but we're kind of very broadly across the industry. So most of that doesn't show up in something that we can move the business overall. But yes, those are a few of the highlights."}

{"doc_type": "earnings_call", "ticker": "CFLT", "period": "2024_Q1", "date": "2024-05-07", "section": "prepared", "speaker": "Edward Kreps", "text": "Thanks, Shane. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to our first quarter earnings call. I'm happy to report we had a strong start to the year, exceeding the high end of all guided metrics. Total revenue grew 25% to $217 million. Confluent Cloud revenue grew 45% to $107 million, which now accounts for the majority of the subscription revenue and remains our fastest-growing offering.\n Non-GAAP operating margin improved 22 percentage points our fourth consecutive quarter of more than 20 points improvement. These results reflect our team's strong execution amid still uncertain but stabilizing macro environment.\n In Q1, we launched our consumption transformation. We oriented our sales compensation for cloud towards incremental consumption and new logo acquisition. We rolled out new systems, metrics and measures and made pricing adjustments, reduced friction and lending new customers. It remains early days but we are in the strong promising signals of our consumption orientation, particularly around new customer acquisition and stabilization of consumption trends.\n With an increased focus on new logo growth, we added 160 customers to our total customer count, our largest sequential growth since Q1 '23. We not only increased the volume of customer additions but we're better able to target high potential customers, increasing the quality of our customer adds as well.\n We recently hosted Kafka Summit in London and Bangalore. Kafka Summit Bangalore was the first ever Kafka Summit in APAC. These events are a great illustration of the tremendous growth and innovation happening within the data streaming category. Between the 2 events, we had more than 7,000 people joining us in person or registered virtually, spanning start-ups, enterprises and everything in between including organizations like Apple, Bloomberg, CERN, ING, Stripe, Uber and many others.\n Our relentless pace of product innovation was on full display with 15 major customer-facing features and pricing performance optimizations announced across both events, including the general availability of Flink and early availability of a powerful new feature we call Tableflow. Tableflow makes all the data streams that flow through Confluent Cloud available as structured tables and cloud object storage using an open table format called Apache Iceberg.\n Let me provide a little background on what this means and why it's so powerful. Historically, data in the analytics and data warehousing world, who's existing in closed systems that tracked their data inside of walled garden. As the complexity of the analytics world has grown, this has led to a mismatch of data warehouses, data links, AI products and reporting systems. This granted lots of value for technology vendors but created yet another data silo for the end user. However, over the last 5 years, a trend has emerged of standardizing around open data formats and metadata on top of cloud object store. The rise of cheap cloud object storage like S3 means another path is possible, instead of fragmenting data across various analytical systems, the tables of data that can be shared across systems.\n Apache Iceberg has arisen as the de facto standard for these open analytic tables on top of cloud object storage. Iceberg is an open source project that has near universal support across the open source systems like Apache Spark and Flink as well as the data warehousing and data lake house world, including products like AWS Athena, RedShift, Google's BigQuery and Snowflake. Tableflow is more than just a connector, already Kafka and Confluent are one of the most common feeds of data into the analytics system. But with Tableflow, we can make that integration far deeper.\n Kora, our cloud native Kafka implementation already heavily relied on cloud object storage for storing the streams of data in Confluent Cloud. Tableflow means that we can open up these same streams directly as iceberg tables with the click of a button. This means data is defined a single time, stored a single time and no complex mappings or translations are needed. Tableflow is in early access now and taking on its first users. For some vendors, the rise of open data formats like Iceberg is perceived as a threat as it opens up data that was locked in a silo to an ecosystem of processing and analytics layers letting vendors compete on a level playing field based on cost, performance and features rather than any new entrant having to overcome significant data gravity. However, we believe Confluent is uniquely positioned to benefit from this trend as our goal and indeed, our business model is built around the sharing of data. So the rise of iceberg creates a very important destination for data that can increase the value of the streams in our platform.\n This makes Tableflow central to Confluent's vision of opening up and connecting all the data in an organization. We've heard overwhelmingly positive feedback from customers with this announcement and look forward to making this a significant part of our business over time. Last quarter, we discussed the world of stream processing and why our Flink offering is uniquely positioned to win this market. And we've been seeing incredibly interesting excitement for our Flink offering. Nearly 600 prospects and customers have tried Flink since its preview.\n At Kafka Summit London, we announced the general availability of Confluent Cloud for Apache Flink. Early customer feedback has been strong. We see many of these customers starting the ramp towards production applications that will drive significant assumption over time. We announced another exciting Flink development at Kafka Summit Bangalore. We'll be adding Flink to our on-premise software offering Confluent Platform. This helps our on-premise and hybrid customers adopt Flink for critical workloads running in their data centers. These are very exciting steps for Confluent and it cements our position as the only complete data streaming platform. Tableflow and Flink are capabilities beyond Kafka and represents significant progress towards building what believe will be the most important data platform in a modern company.\n Gen AI continues to be top of mind for many companies but most are coming to realize that LLM don't stand alone. RAG or retrieval augmented generation has emerged as the common pattern for Gen AI to extend the powerful LLM models to domain specific data sets in a way that avoids hallucination and allows granular access control. Data streaming platforms play a pivotal in enriching RAG-enabled workloads with contextual and trustworthy data. It enables companies to tap into a continuous stream of real-time data to that power the business and transform it into the right to be used by vector basis for AI applications.\n Another announcement from Kafka Summit Bangalore that helps make this kind of RAG architecture easier with support for AI models in remote inference in Flink SQL. This capability is designed to simplify the development and deployment of AI applications by enabling software developers to integrate inference and embedding computation directly into their data processing, making it easier than ever to bring AI to real-time apps.\n We're seeing particularly strong traction with the digital native segment with companies like OpenAI, Notion and Motive. We're leveraging Gen AI to reimagine customer experiences in nearly every industry. One such customer is an AI-powered customer intelligence platform to manage contact centers and customer engagements. A powerful communications AI is central to its platform and is used for a variety of use cases, including surfacing real-time insights for call center managers and identifying when agents need immediate assistance or intervention in handling problematic situations. Their existing architecture was unable to handle the demands of real time with latency sometimes exceeding a minute. This sluggishness was unacceptable for an AI application that requires access to fresh and continuously updated data. So this customer turned to Confluent Cloud for fast and scalable data streaming.\n By integrating Confluent with other components of its architecture, the customer was able to significantly reduce latencies for response times from over a minute down to as slow as 10 milliseconds. With faster, fresher data and more real-time insights available, the customers better equip to meet the needs of its customers and provide them with valuable tools and analytics for managing their contact centers and customer engagements.\n But it's not just digital natives who are putting Gen AI into action. Another great example is GEP Worldwide, a global leader in supply chain and procurement solutions. This $1 billion revenue company provides software consultancy and managed services to some of the world's biggest multinationals. Its software offerings are infused by Gen AI to support chatbots and Decision support tools. Previously the team was an open-source Kafka shop but operating and maintaining Open Source became too burdensome to maintain, ultimately stifling their ability to iterate and innovate quickly. So they turn to Confluent.\n With Confluent serving as the central nervous system of its software, the company is able to more quickly connect data across hundreds of applications, including both custom apps and the operational and analytical estates to provide contextual, relevant and real-time insight into its AI platform. Confluent continues to innovate across our products and partner ecosystem to make it easier for customers, so organizations can quickly scale and build AI-enabled applications using trusted data streams.\n In closing, I'm incredibly proud of our team. Our rapid pace of innovation is phenomenal, and our field and go-to-market teams are leaning into our consumption transformation with early positive results. I've never been more excited or confident in Confluent's ability to capture the lion's share of the data streaming platform market.\n With that, I'll turn things over to Rohan."}
{"doc_type": "earnings_call", "ticker": "CFLT", "period": "2024_Q1", "date": "2024-05-07", "section": "prepared", "speaker": "Rohan Sivaram", "text": "Thanks, Jay. Good afternoon, everyone. We delivered solid first quarter results, beating all our guided metrics and a still uncertain macro environment. Key highlights include robust top line growth and bottom line improvements. The largest sequential customer growth since Q1 2023 and create momentum in multiproduct adoption. These results reflect our team's strong execution on our consumption transformation, and our expanding multiproduct platform leadership in data streaming.\n Turning to the Q1 results. Total revenue grew 25% to $217.2 million. Subscription revenue grew 29% to $206.9 million. Within subscription, Confluent Platform revenue grew 15% to $100.1 million, representing 46% of total revenue. Customers rely on Confluent Platform to harness data streaming on-prem, on the edge and bridge to the cloud. We continue to see healthy demand for Confluent Platform as most organizations are still early in their move to the cloud.\n Confluent Cloud revenue grew 45% to $106.8 million, exceeding our guidance of $105 million and ended the quarter at 49% of total revenue compared to 42% a year ago. Our cloud performance was driven by the ramp in consumption from select customers added in recent quarters, and we started seeing stabilization of new use case expansion in our existing customer base, including our digital native segment.\n Turning to the geographical mix of revenue. Revenue from the U.S. grew 23% to $127.4 million. Revenue from outside the U.S. grew 28% to $89.8 million.\n Moving on to the rest of the income statement. I'll be referring to non-GAAP results unless stated otherwise. Total gross margin was 76.9%, up 470 basis points. Subscription gross margin was 80.7%, up 320 basis points. We are pleased with operating above our long-term target level of 75% for total gross margin even with a continued revenue mix shift to cloud. Our cloud offering has significant architectural advantages in multi-tenancy, elasticity, data balancing, networking and data replication. Combined with continual optimizations at every layer of the stack, we have driven a significant cost advantage in operations while delivering industry-leading innovations to our customers at a lower TCO.\n Turning to profitability and cash flow. Operating margin improved 22 percentage negative 1.5%, representing our seventh consecutive quarter of more than 10 points and fourth quarter of more than 20 points in margin improvement. Operating margin performance was driven by our gross margin performance and our continued focus on driving efficient growth economy with the most pronounced progress made in sales and marketing. The improvements in sales and marketing demonstrates focused efforts in driving operating leverage and improving unit economics.\n Net income per share was $0.05 for Q1, using 350.2 million diluted weighted average shares outstanding. Fully diluted share count under the treasury stock method was approximately 362.4 million. Free cash flow margin improved 33 percentage points to negative 14.6%. And we ended the first quarter with $1.91 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities.\n Turning now to other business metrics. Total customer count was approximately 5,120, representing an increase of 160 customers sequentially. This is our largest sequential growth in total customers since Q1 2023, reflecting the early signs of success from our consumption transformation. Customers with $100,000 in ARR grew 17% to 1,260 and continue to account for greater than 85% of our revenue. Customers with $1 million plus in ARR grew 24% to 168, reflecting the power of our network effect and customers' continued standardization on our data streaming platform. NRR was healthy and in line with our target range of 120% to 125% for this year. Gross retention rate remained strong and was above 90%. \n As discussed in the last quarter, we expect NRR to exceed our midterm target threshold of 125% starting fiscal year '25 as we exit the consumption transformation. RPO was $840.2 million, up 13%. Current RPO was estimated to be $570.6 million, up 20%. As discussed in prior quarters, RPO related metrics are now less relevant given our greater focus on driving consumption for our cloud business. Starting this quarter, investors can access our RPO metrics in our supplemental financials document on our IR website.\n Now I would like to discuss our long-term opportunity with our data streaming platform, or DSP. We have driven success with our cloud-native streaming product with Kafka accounting for the substantial majority of our cloud revenue. Over the last few years, we have added Connect, Process and Govern to complete our multiproduct platform. As Jay mentioned, early customer reception of our stream processing product Flink has been strong. As our customers start building and ramping their streaming applications, we expect Flink will contribute to revenue meaningfully in 2025.\n But Confluent isn't just about streaming and stream processing. Our growth potential with Connect and Govern is often underestimated. Legacy integration companies have a massive installed base around connectors, and this is a significant opportunity for our Connect portfolio. Connect is our first and largest DSP product after streaming and its revenue growth trajectory has been robust. For Govern, the increasing complexity around data, security, regulation, coupled with the rise of Gen AI are driving the demand for our Governance products. In fact, revenue growth for Stream Governance has been the fastest of any products we have launched to date.\n The multiproduct aspect of our unified platform adds to our growth vectors and extends our runway to drive durable and efficient growth. Let me put it into more context. First, each pillar of our platform has the potential to become a large independent business on its own. The 3 DSP products, which include Connect, Process and Govern are early their S-curve of maturity and adoption than Kafka. But over time, we think the growth potential will be larger than Kafka itself.\n Second, our opportunity with our DSP products remain in very early days. In Q1 2024, the 3 DSP products accounted for approximately 10% of cloud revenue, but with a substantially faster growth rate than our overall cloud business. We expect 3 DSP products to remain the fastest-growing part of our business and account for a much larger portion of our cloud revenue over time.\n And third, multiproduct customers have a higher NRR profile. In Q1 2024, customers using 3 or more products in our 100,000-plus customer cohort increased 47% year-over-year. These multiproduct customers had an NRR substantially higher than the company average. This underscores the strong networks of our unified platform, where the success of one product drives additional success in the others.\n As our data streaming platform matures and multiproduct adoption continues to increase, we believe we will be in a stronger position to address our $60 billion market opportunity ahead.\n Before turning to our financial outlook, I'd like to note that our guidance philosophy is consistent with prior quarters with the overall objective of setting prudent and achievable targets. We don't forecast a better or worst macro environment in our guidance. And as a reminder, beginning with the third quarter of 2024, we will fully transition to providing total subscription revenue guidance only.\n Now let's turn to guidance. For the second quarter of 2024, we expect total revenue to be in the range of $229 million to $230 million, representing growth of 21% to 22%.  subscription revenue to be in the range of $217 million to $218 million, representing growth of 23% to 24%.  Cloud revenue to be approximately $116 million, representing growth of approximately 39%.  Non-GAAP operating margin at approximately negative 1%, representing improvement of approximately 8 percentage points, and non-GAAP's net per diluted share to be in the range $0.04 to $0.05.\n For the full year 2024, we now expect total revenue to be approximately $957 million, representing growth of approximately 23%.  Subscription revenue to be approximately $910 million, representing growth of approximately 25%,  non-GAAP operating margin to breakeven, representing improvement of approximately 7 percentage points. Free cash flow margin to breakeven representing improvement of approximately 16 percentage points and non-GAAP net income per diluted share to be in the range of $0.19 to $0.20.\n Finally, we expect net dilution for fiscal year '24 will be approximately 3%, in line with our midterm target. Our long-term target is to bring net dilution down to under 2%, which we expect will drive SBC as a percentage of total revenue down to the mid-teens over time.\n In closing, we are pleased with our strong and bottom line performance in the first quarter. Our consumption transformation has shown early signs of success. The value proposition of our multiproduct platform is resonating with customers. We will stay focused on delivering innovation and value to our customers while continuing to fine-tune our go-to-market effort, which we believe will put us in a stronger position to capture our market opportunity ahead.\n Now Jay and I will take your questions."}

Jay, I want to go back to the big macro environment in terms of just the pace of new software development projects. I remember last year, that had definitely slowed down quite a bit. What are you seeing now in terms of just new software development initiatives? And maybe you can sort of tie that into some of the sales transformation efforts that you have thrown on new organization?"}
{"doc_type": "earnings_call", "ticker": "CFLT", "period": "2024_Q1", "date": "2024-05-07", "section": "qa", "speaker": "Edward Kreps", "text": "Yes. I think we've seen overall stabilization. I would say the focus for a lot of our customers over the last year was really heavy focus on cost optimization with some amount of new developments, but really only the most necessary things. I do think that's picked up a little bit. The -- that's probably most pronounced in the digital native segment where they were probably the hardest hit last year. And they probably have the biggest bounce back in terms of focus on AI-related initiatives and other developments. So I would say that's positive.\n And then on the consumption transformation, I think that's gone really well. I do feel like we've seen -- we had to execute really a large number of changes in a pretty short period of time. And I think we've really significantly derisked the set of changes by rolling out a bunch of system changes. They were well adopted by our field team. They've actually proved themselves out with customers. And I think that's shown up in the higher rate of new customer acquisition. And I think one of the nice things is in addition to just getting more customers, we're actually targeting and getting higher propensity customers. So it's kind of more volume and higher quality book. So yes, we felt like that was overall a really good result."}

I really appreciate the breakout on some of the new product contribution in Q1 2024. In terms of the monetization strategy across the pillars of DSP, could you just sort of just outline that for us?

{"doc_type": "earnings_call", "ticker": "CFLT", "period": "2024_Q1", "date": "2024-05-07", "section": "qa", "speaker": "Edward Kreps", "text": "Yes. Yes. So each of those represents kind of a distinct monetization opportunity. So the connectors, we charge for each of these connectors. There's a couple of pricing levers but it roughly correlates with how many instances of the connector and the amount of volume of data flowing. For Flink, it's kind of the compute hour is very similar to the models you'd see for other processing services like Snowflake. For Governance, it's an uplift that comes as kind of a flat fee as you move to our advanced governance package as well as something that scales up with your usage of the product. And Tableflow is new. So it's just an early access. Now, we haven't announced any pricing but that will also have monetization opportunities that go along with it."}

Maybe as a follow-up to Sanjit's question. You guys have a lot of company-specific drivers that are certainly seeming to be apparent in your numbers.

Just trying to get a sense for how much of it is just sort of more of the environment versus complement specific?"}

I mean I don't know that the specific performance of other companies directly drives us but there's obviously some amount of correlation in all spend in the cloud. If we were breaking out the different things, I would say the success of our consumption transformation thus far. That's an important factor. I think the kind of DSP components that Rohan outlined are early contributors probably, Connect is the furthest along, followed by Governance and Flink just went GA. So that's just starting to ramp to revenue contribution, it'll contribute more coming into next year."}

It sounds like, Jay, you mentioned 600 prospects have tried Flink. It's great to hear. I mean we're starting to hear it show up in partner conversations as well. It sounds like a '25 thing. I'm just wondering Rohan, to -- when you think about it in guidance, are you featuring any Flink contribution in the second half of '24?"}

Well, we've said this before, really Flink is a big opportunity for us. And 2024 is all about adoption and 2025 is all monetization. So from an overall what's included guidance, we're basically assuming that the contribution -- the material contribution from Flink will happen in fiscal '25."}

Jay, on the Flink side, now that you have proper early customer conversations, what are you seeing in terms of the adoption curve you seeing there? And you obviously saw -- have seen Kafka before. What's the early customer conversations there? And what does it drive you if you think about the addressable market coming out of that one?"}
{"doc_type": "earnings_call", "ticker": "CFLT", "period": "2024_Q1", "date": "2024-05-07", "section": "qa", "speaker": "Edward Kreps", "text": "Yes, I would say it's been very positive. There's incredible enthusiasm in our customer base really across the broad set of customers from the kind of digital native to large enterprises. It's early in the adoption for any of these cloud offerings. Nobody wants to build production workloads against the pre-GA product. So this kind of milestone of going GAs really kind of the starting line and then it's really about the build of production workloads. And each workload adds a little bit of continuous revenue production. And as those build up within customers, that's where it starts to contribute meaningfully.\n And so I would say, overall, both the development of that product, the market reception has gone about as well as we could possibly expect as we kind of initiated the development of the Flink offering. Now it's really on us to go execute it as a business and make customers successful with it, which is obviously a very important next step."}

And then one follow-up, Rohan, where I get a lot of the questions at the moment from the financial committees on RPO, cRPO. Maybe it's worth a reminder why that's kind of -- how that number came together and how that number needs to be seen in the overall context of the results?"}

When we think about the consumption transformation, one of the important changes that we are driving is making sure we're driving and incentivizing and focusing on consumption and not the commitment from the customer. And what that means is RPO is nothing but the commitment from the customer. And that not a huge focus for us because what drives Confluent Cloud is next unit of consumption. And as result of that, we said that when you think about the forward-looking indicators of our business, consumption revenue and subscription revenue are true indicators of organic growth and that will be probably a more leading indicator than RPO, cRPO."}

So kind of as we described, I would say that's ramping now, like we're seeing customers that are adopting this. Usually the digital names are a little further ahead in their use cases. This is one of the number of use cases for us. It's not the only thing happening. But it's an important one and I think a strategic one for customers. So yes, I think that as these initiatives hit production, I think we'll see an increasing ramp of contribution from them heading into next year. The -- what their customers are using is really the full platform. Like our role in this is to supply chain of data. So that involves our connectors, involves Kora, our Kafka engine, it'll increasingly involved Flink and the integration into the LLM that we just announced in Kafka Summit Bangalore. And so yes, I think all of that will be driven by these use cases."}

Rohan, can you talk about hiring right now? You seem to be doing a good job managing expenses but I assume that with things stabilizing, you guys are ramping up some of your hiring, and that's one of the reasons why the op margins are going to be flat this year, which is maybe some thoughts on the hiring."}

I mean, Jason, when we really think about our resource allocation philosophy, it is obviously driving durable and efficient growth. And when I say durable growth, it's essentially extending our runway to growth over a long period of time. And as we think about that, of course, like investment and investment in headcount is a key part of that. So for example, in Q1, we've had one of our strongest hiring quarters for the go-to-market organization, which is great. And so yes, I think we feel pretty good with respect to where we are and how we are thinking about a balanced approach on growth and profitability. \n On your question on the margins, as you know, over the last, say, 24 odd months, we've improved our efficiency by over 40 percentage points. And heading into this year, we're on track to deliver the 7 percentage point improvement, which is going to get us to breakeven for the full year, and we are on track to get there."}

Jay, back to Flink, is there a way to think about the customers you see as best suited to take advantage of the offering. I'm wondering if the addition of platform is important from that perspective.

So we've certainly seen interest across our customer base. One of the things that we will see is a slightly different dynamic between the Confluent Platform Flink offering and the cloud offering. With the cloud offering, the early versions of the cloud offering tend to be best suited to new use cases, just beginning development, whereas there's more of a lift in shift opportunity on-premise as well as suiting new use cases. Over time, as that cloud offering reaches feature completeness and proofs itself out with customers, there will be more of a shift of existing Flink workloads, that's the behavior we saw with Kafka, where the early adoption was the incremental use case and the lift and shift of kind of large installed bases took more time.\n So I think we'll see a similar behavior here and that's what we've seen out of customers. Nonetheless, across the full set of customers. There's a ton of eagerness. So people are kind of lining up. Even if there's some feature they're waiting on, they're eagerly awaiting the delivery of that feature. So yes, I think that we'll see growth on both dimensions.\n In terms of why we added to the software offering Confluent platform, that was by popular demand. Originally, the intention was just to do in cloud. Ultimately we have a set of customers that have pretty extensive on-premise operations, some of them are very big Flink users and they were very eager to have an offering for them as well. And for us, our goal is to serve customers everywhere. And so as soon as we add capacity to kind of take on the development of that, we added plans for that and built it up."}

I mean, the early indicators from the consumption transformation have been very positive. And we've gone through made a lot of changes with respect to processes, systems. And some of the early data points, for example, if you look at the ads that we had in Q1, the highest we've had in 5 quarters. Obviously, early but very positive. And then when you look at our Q1 performance in general, we're very pleased with our total revenue performance and particularly our cloud revenue performance and the growth we saw 45% year-over-year. And that momentum has actually continued into the month 1 of the second quarter as well.\n So when you kind of put this into context, Michael, for the full year, we've increased our full year guidance from 22% to 23%. And what has also happened is we've delivered a strong Q1 with a strong guide for Q2. So that has somehow derisked the second half of the year in a manner, which we're uncandidly very happy about. And more importantly, when you look at the growth rates first half versus second half, that was obviously a point of discussion same time last quarter. Now we're looking at flattish because of the derisk nature of our first half performance. So overall, I would say early indication very positive, feel good about our full year guide and obviously happy about our Q1 performance."}

We were actually expecting a fair amount of enthusiasm around this. As you said, there's a great deal of buzz around Iceberg. Despite that, I think we were actually surprised by how widespread the interest was. And we felt like, well, in many ways, sometimes the analytics environment is kind of a little bit to the side of the team that we naturally serve. We weren't sure if they would have a direct interest in that. But in fact, it's been a huge drop and topic of discussion in almost every conversation that I've had with the customers. So no, it's on us to deliver a GA product. This is just the first step in that journey. So it would be too early to project the rate of adoption or revenue contribution or whatever, but we feel that, that has a ton of potential as it comes out onto the market.\n And as I said, it does kind of align with our business in, I think, a really fantastic way. Confluent is very much about opening up data and sharing it across an organization. And this is a fantastic mechanism for us to do that. In many ways, the fragmentation of the analytics market made it hard to deliver data and the volume that we would like across all the different systems there. And this really helps with that. And our ability to integrate that directly into Kora and offer that data in a very natural low friction, low overhead way, I think, is a great competitive differentiation.\n And I think a huge boon to that area as well where one of the challenges in that environment is always getting access to high-quality, reliable data that's up to date. So yes, I think we're very excited about it. Still early and we have to go finish the delivery of the product and make all the customers' success."}

Is it fair to think that your shift in this to prioritize consumption over commitments is actually driving faster adoption across Confluent's Platform? Or is it still too early to start seeing this in the numbers? This has been like a slow go but that's something to come as a result of this go-to-market transformation you guys have..."}

It's -- actually, it's a very good observation. So this is a subtle point but previously, the field team really sold commitments, which was just dollars. And so the incentive to drive adoption of these DSP components was much less, right? Of course, the customer adopt Flink, they'll consume more as it comes time for them to renew next year, they might commit to more but that payoff could be a year out. It's somewhat delayed. In a consumption world, of course, consumption ramps higher the immediate compensation arrives, right? And so that payoff is much more immediate. And so the consumption transformation was actually quite important for driving adoption of these additional components around Kafka.\n In terms of have we seen that effect? Yes, I think we've seen an increased focus from our field team on these components to us. The use cases around that it's not like it just materializes overnight to all in 1 quarter, that will build that getting that model right to be set up for multiproduct delivery, was actually a substantial motivation for us in doing this more quickly because we felt we had actually very good offerings now around Kafka, and we wanted to make sure that we were set up to sell them."}

And then just a follow-up on the go-to-market, a bit of a 2-parter here. But I guess to start with, Jay, like, it's interesting, one of the things that I think you guys are calling out is attach you're seeing from even higher quality customers despite the fact that you're not pressing on commitments, right? And I would have thought the presumption would be that if you're not pressing on commitments, your might get some lower quality customers. So can you kind of tease that out for folks, I think that would be beneficial?\n And then I guess, the second piece for Rohan, if you could just articulate like I know there was a lot of angst into the first half of this year, given the go-to-market change but like what more is there to do on your front now that you guys are kind of clicking along here with, call it, 4 months and change behind you?"}

I start with the bid on customers. Yes, so the change we made on the field side was to directly incentivize the land as part of the comp plan. But not only that to actually target a set of high potential customers that we felt were particularly important to land and compensate even more highly for those because those will be worth a lot more to Confluent as they ramp to large consumption. And so what was exciting to us was not only the volume of customers go up but then as you said, yes, those were actually better targeted into that set of high propensity spenders than they had been previously. \n And that -- I think that's just the direct result of the incentives. And we had that differentiation because as I said, we want to make sure these are high-quality customer additions that we're picking up.\n And I'll let you take the second half, Rohan."}

On -- Mike, on the second half, we're obviously, -- we saw this was the first quarter of the transformation and  Jay called out earlier, the early indications have been very positive, which showed up in our cloud performance for the quarter. And more importantly, when we look at our month 1 and how we are entering Q2, we feel good that some of the momentum has actually carried on to Q2. So that's good. But in general, like we still have a couple of quarters of execution that we need to focus on.\n But if you ask me how am I feeling? Obviously, what's evident in our Q1 performance and our Q2 guide, which are strong and which we feel are ahead of our expectations. And what that does is the strength in the first half is also derisking our second half from an overall guidance perspective. So overall, where we are, we feel really good with the transformation but at the same time, we still need to execute a couple of more quarters."}

Some of these that are actually product offerings, which effectively allow better TCO and incentivize the use of our multi-tenant offerings, which are more efficient for us. So we announced freight clusters in Kafka Summit Bangalore. We announced enterprise cluster type, which is a high-performing multi-tenants offering with private networking. We made adjustments to some of the throughput-oriented pricing. So there was a number of changes that came out. All of these were meant to reduce friction in the land and expand process. We've thought about those consumption transformation. A big part of it was changes on the field team, changes in our systems, changes in compensation. \n But I think going along with that, we felt it was very important that there will not be a ton of product or pricing friction in that land process, right? So if we're trying to tell the team to go sell in a way that gets customers up and going, it can't be the case to get to a reasonable price. There's a 6-month negotiation at the very front door of the process. And so those changes have lined up with that.\n Why do that? It's ultimately because there's a ton of Open Source Kafka and we want to go soak that up with our cloud offering. We feel that's a very important. So kind of growing the breadth of that customer base that sets us up for all the growth on those customers over time. And we do feel like these kind of changes and new offerings unlock workloads that would have been harder to access, and that comes out of the TCO of the offering, right? We've talked in the past about how Kora is able to really offer a better TCO for customers. And it's important that we make sure we have offerings that cut across all the different workloads they have, so that it's a bit of a no-brainer across everything they do, not just a certain workload type or a certain use case. So that was our goal."}

And over the last few years, we have seen a pretty significant ramp-up in Confluent Cloud adoption. And I would say that, that happened first in the smaller banks. And then over time, that spread to some of the largest financial institutions. And they tend to be a little bit slower to start with the new cloud offering. There's actually very substantial security, reliability, scrutiny that goes into the adoption of any part of their stack but increasingly, we're really a great fit for their use cases and it actually allow them to meet the requirements that they have faster if they are trying to build this out themselves.\n And so we've started to see great adoption of cloud and financial services. I think that's a very promising thing as these very large institutions open up something that has very low friction to consume across their very broad set of use cases. So we're really excited about kind of getting in the front door in a lot of these very large banks."}

And so it's just some underlying share shifting or whether or not we should think about like slower growth going forward on that side of the business given that it's an important part of the revenue stream."}

Thanks for your question, Peter. Well, when we look at our Confluent Platform performance, we're very pleased actually. We grew 15% year-over-year. And when you generally think about the Platform business, more of as a reminder, what happens is about 20% of total contract value is recognized as license revenue upfront. So what that can do, that can add a little bit of lumpiness in the revenue. Clearly, based on the timing of large deals or the timing of renewals for large deals, those have an impact. But when I take a step back and I look at, say, in the last 12 months for this business, we've been very pleased with the overall momentum. And Jay also called out with respect to product innovation, we launched a Flink on-prem, which is obviously going to help this part of the business as well.\n So yes, I mean, listen, we've said that Confluent needs to be wherever our data and applications are side. If it's on-prem, we need to be on-prem, if it's in the cloud, we need to be cloud. Just keeping that in mind, we do feel that this is going to be an important part of the business as we look ahead."}

I would say we have a kind of strong status as a de facto for real-time movement across the enterprise. There is opportunities for customers to just try and build it and batch. There's plenty of batch GTL products. The reality is though for a lot of these use cases, there are interesting questions about the business, and that's really just not good enough.\n For a lot of these use case, it's something that's customer support related or in other words, driving some aspects of the business where kind of answering without of data information is very likely to wrong relative to what the customer was just viewing.

So that's good, that's a broad base of our customer. And the second call out was newer customers. We've seen the ramp-up of these newer customers, I'd say, something that we are very pleased on. And the Gen AI customer that you spoke about is probably in that [ port ] of customers. It's a few of them who've kind of we've run and where the ramp schedule looks in line and we're pretty happy with that. And that's for Q1.

Yes, I mean our goal is to open up the full set of APIs. So the first thing we launched was SQL. Our intention is to bring out Java and Python APIs as well. We think they serve differences. There's a set of kind of core applications that will probably always be in these more application-oriented programming languages like Java. There's a set of more dynamic use cases and transformations, which are well suited to SQL. One of the powerful things about Flink is kind of opening up that broad set of tools, all on top of a core engine, I think that's one of the things that's made it the leader in stream processing.\n And as we do that, yes, our goal is very much to make this easier and easier to use. The -- for a long time, I think it's been the case that customers would prefer real-time data. They would rather work with apps that updated in real time, they reacted in real time, they would rather to connect things in real time. Nobody wants the data to be slow. It's actually just been difficult to do that. So making this really easy is kind of a core way of enabling this. Like there's an obvious benefit if you can make it not more costly and not more complicated for our customers.\n So when you see us kind of focusing on both this ease of development and TCO orientated things, that really is the kind of core thing that drives this, and as we do we think there's a huge opportunity for this whole set of batch data movement, batch processing that really needs to move and will move as the alternative becomes appealing because of that ease of use in TCO."}

{"doc_type": "earnings_call", "ticker": "CFLT", "period": "2024_Q1", "date": "2024-05-07", "section": "qa", "speaker": "Edward Kreps", "text": "Yes. Yes, it's a great question. So yes, AI is definitely one of the drivers. I would say that there's a whole set of forces that have driven interest in data governance. One of those is just the kind of rising compliance regime around data. GDPR is to start but there's a long list of things that organizations have to do. The second is around just the safety of data. The third is actually around opening it up. Those first two are maybe things you have to do. But in order to really take advantage of data, it has to be the case that the right team can find the right data set, what it means at the right time, that kind of discovery process, documentation is actually really critical to the integrity of data as something that customers can build around and against.\n And then as you said, all of that, I think, has been supercharged by AI, where you have a set of applications that are much more data rich to draw on many more data sources across an organization than a traditional enterprise app might. But in order for that to work well, you have to know what's going work. And is it up to date? Is it getting there in the right way? Is it supposed to be there at all? And managing all of that has just gotten harder and harder, and managing it on top of some trusty set of old bespoke pipelines is trending towards impossible, and I think that's one of the things that's driven the rise of data streaming. And the nice thing for us is the ability to bring these governance capabilities kind of right there with the Platform. So there's no extra effort to go and adopt this use case by use case. The data is naturally tracked as it flows, you have the lineage of what goes where, you've kind of strong schemas that allow the creation of these data products that are shared across organization. And this is a really powerful thing for customers as they think about how they use this technology in the large and how they really take advantage of the day that they have to better serve customers and be more efficient.\n And on the unit economics, yes, this will change over time as that product line develops. Right now, it is kind of a step up with some additional usage as you use it more broadly. I think we're adding more and more functionality around the encryption of fields of data around other aspects of how you use and analyze data, and I think that will increase the monetization over time. I think it's too early to call the kind of final pending state ratio probably for any of these offerings but we do think that, that will be a sizable business for us."}

So not a whole lot to call out there with respect to any impact one way or the other on gross margins."}

{"doc_type": "earnings_call", "ticker": "CFLT", "period": "2023_Q4", "date": "2024-02-07", "section": "prepared", "speaker": "Jay Kreps", "text": "Thanks, Shane. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to our fourth quarter earnings call. We closed fiscal year 2023 with a solid Q4, exceeding the high end of our guided metrics. Total revenue grew 26% to $213 million. Confluent Cloud revenue reached $100 million for the first time, growing 46% and non-GAAP operating margin came in at 5.3%, our first positive quarter, improving 27 percentage points. Since going public two and a half years ago, we have more than doubled our total revenue run rate and driven more than 46 percentage points in non-GAAP operating margin improvement. These results are a testament to the power of our platform and the incredible growth of the data streaming category. Last quarter, we discussed our accelerated transition to a fully consumption oriented, go-to-market model for Confluent Cloud, including shifting our sales compensation for cloud to be based on incremental consumption and new logo acquisition, orienting our field team towards landing new customers and driving new workloads with customers and adapting product and pricing to reduce friction in landing customers and maximize the potential for expansion. As we said before, these changes are internal to our go-to-market teams and don't change our business model or revenue model or any other customer facing aspect, all of which are already consumption oriented. We've executed some of the initial changes of our consumption transformation effective January 1, including a new compensation model and the initial rollout of new systems, metrics and measures. Last week, I spent time with our sales and marketing teams at our sales kickoff. The initial reaction from the team has been very positive. We will be spending the next few quarters fully adapting and optimizing our business to these changes. We believe our transition to a fully consumption oriented business, alongside our category leadership puts us in an excellent position to capture more of the $60 billion data streaming platform opportunity in front of us. I'd like to spend a few minutes and reflect on the increasing recognition of data streaming as a category and its potential for growth. One way of thinking about data technologies is to break them into two groups; those oriented for handling Data at Rest, the databases and storage systems, and those oriented at handling data in motion. These two areas had very different evolutionary paths. Over the last several decades, Data at Rest has become highly concentrated around a powerful infrastructure platform, the database, a $90 billion plus category. The landscape of Data in Motion technologies remained highly fragmented, with technology analysts recognizing disparate technology categories including message queues, application integration tools, data integration tools, event brokers, ETL products, iPass, and more. The reason for this was largely technological. Each of these product categories was defined by its technological limits, whether latency, scale, complexity of processing, or ease of use. The potential for data streaming is to collapse the fragmentation of Data in Motion technologies and create a new data platform that supersedes each of these limited precursors. Since Confluent creation, that has been our central thesis that the data streaming platform would be a data platform of similar importance and scale to databases, but acting as the central nervous system handling all the data in motion. Now that this category has gotten to scale in usage, it's starting to get formal recognition. In December, research published by Forrester validated our thesis that data streaming platforms are a distinct category that has become a mission-critical component of the modern data stack. The Forester Wave Streaming Data Platforms Q4 2023 recognizes streaming data as the pulse of an enterprise and names Confluent a leader. We were also named a leader in the Forrester Wave Cloud data pipelines Q four 2023 and won InfoWorld's Technology of the Year in the data management streaming technology category. Taken together, these recognitions show us that the data streaming era is here and Confluent is the clear leader. As we've discussed before, this data streaming platform is more than just Kafka. Kafka is the data stream, a foundational layer, but it's just the start. To extract the full value of data in motion, organizations need to connect to the systems they have, process data in real-time, and govern these flows of data across the enterprise. Each of these capabilities, connectors, stream processing and governance, is on a path to become a sizable business on their own. One key aspect of our consumption transformation is that it lets our go-to-market directly drive consumption around these additional products, which can be used under the same consumption contract with no additional purchasing friction. Today, I'd like to spend a few minutes covering what's happening in the world of stream processing. Stream processing enables organizations to act on data as it arrives, rather than waiting to process it in batch at the end of the day. For an airline, it could be processing data from streams of flight times, weather information, and customer information. By itself, these streams are powerful, but with stream processing, these streams can be combined and enriched to drive logistics, pricing, scheduling and cascade that information throughout the system to minimize travel disruptions. For Confluent this represents a significant growth opportunity. Today the spend on applications around the data stream is significantly higher than on the stream itself. By making these applications easier to build and bringing that spend into our platform, we believe both adoption of our platform as well as the growth of our business will be accelerated. I'd like to spend the next few minutes addressing the question of why Confluent is uniquely positioned to succeed in stream processing with our Flink offering. There are three key reasons I'll address. First, Flink is the emerging de facto standard. Second, the company with the stream gets the processing and third is the rise of data products. Let me address each of these in turn. The first reason is perhaps the most obvious. We believe Flink is simply the best technology in this space and has attracted the largest community of developers working with real-time apps. This technological superiority comes from the fact that Flink was designed to have the full processing power of a database, but was designed from the ground up for streaming, addressing batch processing needs as a special case of stream processing. This affects every aspect of the design, from how storage is managed, how failover and fault tolerance works, to the latency of results and the interfaces presented to users. This is dramatically better than attempts to bolt streaming features into existing databases or batch processing engines. The result is our ability to offer the most complete platform and ecosystem for stream processing, one that supports SQL as well as native apps in popular programming languages, and it unifies batch and real-time processing. This platform has attracted the most vibrant community doing development in this space. The developers have spoken and like Kafka, this is the technology that they choose when they need real time streaming. In 2023, there were nearly 1 million unique downloads of Flink and a 43% increase in open job requisitions for Flink developers. And like Kafka, it has proven itself with one of the most sophisticated user bases, including companies like Apple, Capital One, Netflix, Stripe and Uber. Perhaps what's most impressive is that Flink has attracted this broad adoption in apex users without having significant commercial backing or go-to-market support. This is truly the best engineers picking the best technology. Our investment in Flink gives us a leadership position in the winning technology in stream processing, but our advantage isn't limited to the technology or developer community. As attractive as stream processing is, it doesn't stand alone. It is always adopted along with a stream of data that needs processing. Everyone agrees that Kafka is the standard for the stream itself. As the leaders in Kafka, we are in a prime position for capturing the emerging stream processing market. Indeed, this pairing is very similar to what made databases themselves successful. Databases brought together data storage with data processing into a unified product, driving a vastly simpler experience. Confluent is working towards the same by unifying data streaming with Kafka with stream processing via Flink. We believe the resulting data streaming platform is exactly the product the customers want. This pairing is not just skin deep, either. Confluent can make the stream and processing layers work together as a coherent product that is optimized as a single system, from performance to security to data discoverability to transactional semantics. And we think the processing layer that is unified with the underlying stream is going to be the easiest, fastest, and most obvious choice for any developer. That makes Confluent Flink offering a kind of default option when it comes to processing data in Kafka. There's a final trend that supports Confluent's position in stream processing, and that is the increasing role of reusable data products in modern data architecture. In classical data architecture, data largely lived in a silo and at most was extracted to a single destination, the data warehouse, where it was processed to clean it up and make it usable for various reporting and analytics use cases. In modern data architecture, the data warehouse is no longer the single destination for data. Dozens or even hundreds of other systems feed off critical data streams. Repeating the processing that cleans up data for use dozens or hundreds of times is completely infeasible. The result is that the processing is being pulled upstream from the destination to the source to produce high quality, reusable data products. That is, rather than having dozens of destination systems, all try to clean up the data. Instead the source is responsible for publishing data in a processed, ready-to-use format to all destinations. This means the processing is happening on the stream as data enters the system rather than in the destination, and this is pulling workloads from batch processing in the destinations into stream processing at the source. This is why, structurally, we expect the bulk of stream processing won't happen in destination systems like databases, data warehouses, or data lakes. We think these three reasons are each powerful enough to draw processing workloads into the data streaming platform and put together will make the DSP the nexus of NextGen data workloads. We continue to see demand from customers who are building the next wave of generative AI applications, including AI powered procurement software, chatbots, coding platforms, and even unexpected use cases like predicting and detecting cavities. These organizations turn to Confluent to quickly build and scale gen AI applications that connect their proprietary systems to LLMs so they can deliver trustworthy and contextually rich insights to their customers. We believe this represents a tremendous opportunity for Confluent as customers evolve from experimentation in the short-term to production in the medium and long-term. We continue to invest in our product and in our partner ecosystem to address the demands we see across customers. Alongside Anthropic, we recently partnered with a vector database vendor, Pinecone, and their new Pinecone serverless offering. Our integration allows customers to build retrieval augmented generation or RAG pipelines that allow customers to bring together the real-time state of their proprietary data sources with general purpose AI models. OpenAI has become the poster child of Gen AI. In Q4 OpenAI signed with us to improve their visibility into customer usage patterns. We are still in early stages with this customer, but we have already identified additional use cases, including ways to help reduce costs across their stack. This customer and others like it continue to validate the strategic role of data streaming in the generative AI landscape."}

A fast growing e-commerce brand is a great example. By matching the world of fashion to the best technology, this company has experienced massive growth. In 2023, it reached tens of millions of new app users while growing its customer base by 100% in the last 18 months. Previously, their data platform relied on open source Kafka to power end-to-end e-commerce workflows, fulfilment, real-time inventories and order management. But with the company's explosive growth came challenges scaling open source Kafka, resulting in large maintenance overheads and over provisioning. So in Q4, they turned to Confluent Cloud with a seven figure deal to power six business services that previously used open source Kafka and plans to leverage our full platform, including steering, Stream Governance, connectors and stream processing, to support their ambitious growth goals. In closing, we're pleased with our strong finish to fiscal year 2023. We are more confident than ever that our transformation to a fully consumption oriented business and continued innovation in our category leading platform will serve as a catalyst for winning the $60 billion market opportunity in front of us. With that, I'll turn things over to Rohan."}
{"doc_type": "earnings_call", "ticker": "CFLT", "period": "2023_Q4", "date": "2024-02-07", "section": "prepared", "speaker": "Rohan Sivaram", "text": "Thanks Jay. Good afternoon everyone. I'll start with a brief recap of our full year results. In fiscal year 2023, total revenue grew 33% to $777 million. Confluent Cloud revenue grew 65% to $348.8 million and non-GAAP operating margin improved 23 percentage points to end the year at negative 7.4%. This includes the fourth quarter where we achieved our first positive non-GAAP operating margin of 5.3%, far exceeding the breakeven target we set a year ago. As we look back at fiscal year 2023, we are pleased to have delivered on our commitment of driving higher revenue growth while accelerating our path to positive non-GAAP operating margin by one year. Our ability to achieve $750 million plus revenue and positive non-GAAP operating margin in just nine years since the company's founding is a major accomplishment. It required substantial effort across every team in the company to achieve this milestone. I'm proud of our incredibly talented teams at Confluent and I'd like to thank our employees, customers and partners for their important contribution throughout the years. Turning to the Q4 results, key highlights include robust subscription revenue growth with our first$100 million quarter for both Confluent Cloud and Confluent Platform. Record high non-GAAP total gross margin, driven by strong unit economics of our product offerings and our first positive quarter for both non-GAAP operating margin and free cash flow margin, underscoring our commitment to driving efficient growth at scale. Total revenue for the quarter grew 26% to $213.2 million. Subscription revenue grew 31% to $202.8 million. Within subscription, Confluent Platform revenue grew 18% to $102.8 million, representing 48% of total revenue. The strength was driven by healthy demand for Confluent Platform in regulated industries. Confluent Cloud revenue grew 46% to $100 million, exceeding our guidance of $97.5 million and ended the quarter at 47% of total revenue, compared to 41% of revenue a year ago and 46% last quarter. We are pleased with the healthy consumption we saw in our digital native customers despite a still uncertain macro environment. Turning to the geographical mix of revenue, revenue from the U.S. grew 27% to $127.6 million. Revenue from outside the U.S. grew 25% to $85.5 million. Moving on to rest of the income statement, I'll be referring to non-GAAP results unless stated otherwise. Total gross margin reached another record high of 77.5%, up 450 basis points. Subscription gross margin also reached a record high of 81.1%, up 240 basis points. Gross margin outperformance was driven by strong Confluent Platform margin and the efficiency and optimization we continue to realize in our cloud offering. Turning to profitability and cash flow, we achieved positive operating margin for the first time as a public company, improving 27 percentage points to 5.3%, representing our 6th consecutive quarter of more than 10 points and third consecutive quarter of more than 20 points in margin improvement. Our relentless focus on driving operational efficiency across the company resulted in improvement in every category of our operating expenses, with the largest improvement of 16 percentage points in sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of total revenue. Net income per share was $0.09 for Q4 using 342.4 million diluted weighted average shares outstanding. Fully diluted share count under the treasury stock method was approximately 356.1 million. Free cash flow margin also turned positive in the quarter, improving 21 percentage points to 3.2%, and we ended the fourth quarter with $1.9 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. Turning now to other business metrics. In Q4 total customer count grew 9% to approximately 4960. Customers with 100k or more in ARR grew 21% to 1229 and customers with $1 million or more in ARR grew 24% to 158. We ended fiscal year '23 with 19 customers with $5 million or more in ARR, up from nine customers a year ago. This reflects our customers' strong confidence in standardizing on our data streaming platform, making Confluent the central nervous system of their technology stack. We believe the completion of our consumption transformation in fiscal year '24 will help accelerate the growth of our total customer count. In fact, we saw good traction in total customer count in January. While early, we believe the transformation will make it even easier for our customers and prospects to try, adopt and expand across stream, connect, process and govern in our product portfolio. NRR in the quarter was slightly above 125%, exceeding our midterm target threshold of 125%. Gross retention rate remained strong and was above 90%. As discussed last quarter, we expect NRR will be between 120% and 125% as we go through our consumption transformation this year. As we exit the transformation and starting fiscal year '25, we expect NRR to revert to Q4 '23 levels and exceed our midterm target threshold of 125%. RPO was $919.9 million, up 24%. Current RPO estimated to be 64% of RPO was $591.9 million, up 30%. As called out last quarter, RPO related metrics are less relevant beginning this year given our greater focus on driving consumption for our cloud business.\naquahire: Now, I would like to discuss Confluent's positioning for 2024 and beyond. Driven by our TAM, technology and team, we have shown in our 2023 results our success in driving efficient growth at scale. In 2024 our TAM, technology and team are only getting stronger. First, our $60 billion plus TAM is underpinned by the prevalence of data streaming, as more than 150,000 organizations have built around streaming along with long-term secular tailwinds such as cloud migration and Gen AI. Second, our technology differentiation is expanding rapidly. We have successfully evolved from a single product streaming company to the industry's only data streaming platform company. Our DSP is cloud native, complete with stream, connect, process and govern and available everywhere. Our customers are excited about the innovation we plan to bring to the market in 2024 as we have one of the most exciting product release cycles coming up in the history of the company, starting with Flink GA in Q1. Finally, our team has proven ability to execute with the latest accomplishment of delivering higher revenue growth annually while improving non-GAAP operating margin by more than 46 points in just ten quarters. In 2024, we have strong alignment and commitment across every function of the company to deliver on our consumption transformation. This will put us in a better position, more aligned with our customers to address the $60 billion plus TAM in front of us. Given this backdrop, we are focused on sustaining efficient growth in 2024 by delivering our first breakeven year for both non-GAAP operating margin and free cash flow margin. Given our solid Q4 performance, we feel confident in delivering 22% total revenue growth for 2024 and eventually returning to our midterm target growth of 30%. Turning now to our guidance. As announced on our last earnings call, we will be transitioning our revenue guidance metrics to subscription revenue beginning this quarter. To assist the investment community with transitioning to our new guidance practice, we will continue to provide total revenue guidance for the first two quarters of 2024 and for full year 2024. We will fully transition to providing only subscription revenue guidance beginning with Q3. For the first quarter of 2024, we expect total revenue to be in the range of $211 million to $212 million, representing growth of 21% to 22%. Subscription revenue, which is our new guidance metric and consists of Confluent Cloud and Confluent Platform revenue will be in the range of $199 million to $200 million, representing growth of 24% to 25%. Non-GAAP operating margin at approximately negative 4%, representing improvement of approximately 19 percentage points, and non-GAAP net income per diluted share to be approximately 0 to $0.02. For the full year 2024, we expect total revenue to be approximately $950 million representing growth of approximately 22%, non-GAAP operating margin to breakeven, representing improvement of approximately 7 percentage points, and non-GAAP net income per diluted share of approximately $0.17. Additionally, I'd like to provide some modeling points. We expect Confluent Cloud revenue in Q1 to be approximately $105 million, representing growth of approximately 43%. We expect free cash flow margin in fiscal year '24 to breakeven, representing improvement of approximately 16 percentage points. Consistent with prior years, Q1 free cash flow margin will continue to show pronounced seasonality, primarily due to our corporate bonus payout, employee stock purchase program and the holdback payment related to our Immerok acquisition. Despite these headwinds, we expect Q1 free cash flow margins to improve approximately 20 percentage points year-over-year. Finally, we are pleased with decreasing our annualized net dilution from 4.7% in fiscal year '22 to 3.5% in fiscal year '23. We expect net dilution for fiscal year '24 will be approximately 3%, in-line with our midterm target. Our goal over the long-term is to bring net dilution down to under 2%. In summary, we are pleased with closing out the year with solid fourth quarter results. Our track record of improving non-GAAP operating margin is a testament to the power of our innovation engine and our commitment of driving efficient growth. Looking forward to 2024, we are focused on achieving our first positive non-GAAP operating margin and free cash flow margin for the full year while delivering on our top line commitment. Now, Jay and I will take your questions."}

I appreciate you taking the question. Jay, I want to go back to some of the partnerships you mentioned. You caught out a few captivating companies with Anthropic, Pinecone and then the OpenAI customer relationships. So I'm just wondering, is there commonality in terms of their needs for data streaming? Are there reasons they're landing with Confluent versus open source Kafka? I think this is obviously new ground for all of us, so just anything else you can provide just to help us understand what drove those is useful."}

The need is very much to bring together the kind of proprietary enterprise data you would have with one of these more generic language models that kind of knows about the world but doesn't know the up to the second view of your business and what's happening. And so that's very much the use case where we tend to play in that. So the partnerships with the vector databases like Pinecone, the models, it's very much around supporting that architecture. And our goal was really to support the integration across the best technologies in that space and I think was very much embraced on the other side by these companies that are trying to do that. And then OpenAI, this is an incredible technology company that I think has the potential to be the size of Google over time in terms of the scale of their infrastructure. We're extremely happy to be part of that stack."}

Yes, of course, I mean it all starts with our Q4 execution. We delivered subscription revenue growth of 31% and total revenue growth of 26%. And a couple of milestones, the first quarter of $100 million for both Confluent Platform and Cloud. That coupled with just the green shoots we started seeing in the digital native segment with respect to the consumption was, I'd say one area in general, Q4 execution was solid. I think number two, on the consumption transformation side, Michael, we saw good early traction with respect to where exactly where we want to be. As Jay mentioned, we were at sales kickoff last week, and the feedback was very, very positive. And generally, like one month in, we're getting just positive signals with respect to our transformation. So that's that. And in general, when you think about our guidance philosophy, if you look at our Q1 and full year guidance, we're not assuming a huge amount of acceleration in the second half of the year. So that, I mean, when you combine all of these, it just gives us, I'd say, more confidence around our 2024 guide."}

Just to pick up on the previous question and some of the themes last quarter, Jay I think one of the themes that you called out last quarter was just that software development projects had slowed down throughout the course of calendar 2023. It doesn't sound like you're giving the all clear signs just yet, but there seems to be some encouraging signs with, like new logo acquisition in January. In terms of what you're seeing from the customer base and sort of them sort of restarting some innovation initiatives, any update there that you can tell us as it relates to potentially driving pipeline for Confluent?"}

I think '23 was just a tight year for it budgets kind of everywhere. And then in the digital native space, it was extra, extra tight where there was very significant push on optimization. Where are we now? Yes, I wouldn't say it's all back to where 2021 was, but there are some green shoots. Right? We've definitely seen more activity in the digital native space where I think some of the optimization has been accomplished. So there's projects happening there. I think maybe there's kind of a normalization across both large enterprise and digital native where people are getting a little bit back to normal. It's early in calling out, but I would say that's the early part of what we've seen."}

I want to follow up on Michael Turrin's question around these partnerships Jay and AI use cases, which you called out in your press release, I think, where you referenced real time generative AI use cases as really being at the forefront right now. If we kind of go back to where we were at your analyst event in New York, I don't know if that was six or eight months ago, it feels like with these partnerships, this is really more coming into focus and into fruition. Can you give us any prospective view in terms of like the types of use cases and the extent to which this is really going to materialize into demand, which I think, again, reflecting back six to eight months ago was a little bit unclear as things were shifting in the world exactly, you kind of knew Confluent was participating, but I think you left the door open to exactly how, if you could articulate that, that would be great."}

That's the broad version of it that could be around augmenting internal employees and making them effective. That could be something customer facing. That could be kind of a back end data processing task. We see that across a variety of disciplines, whether it's, I'd call out some of them, but everything from kind of retail to tech companies to financial services. So I think that's happening. Where are we at in that cycle? I'd say it's still early. There's more experiments than production applications and obviously we're kind of a production data analyst, so that's where we come into play. But I think it's definitely promising and kind of adds to the set of use cases that we have that drive adoption of this new architecture around data streaming."}

Thanks, Jay. Great job on the quarter, better Q1 guide than we were modeling, but would I be wrong to assume, and just what I think I'm hearing from you is that you're feeling better about the environment and growth opportunity versus a quarter ago given you've nudged up your 2024 guidance. But you're still keeping the margin guide for flat, making me wonder, are you hiring more into the opportunity you see ahead or is there maybe dilution from Notable?

On the margin side, we have a guide of 7 percentage point improvement year-over-year. That's holding to what we said a year back. So I wouldn't call out anything specific. I called out that Notable does not have any material impact on our financials and it's included in the guidance. But in general, as we head into 2024, we will hire in critical areas of the business and to overall make sure that we are driving durable growth and doing that efficiently in a thoughtful manner."}

Following up on Brad's question a bit and focusing on the TAM for data streaming, do you have a sense for the percentage of workload, Jay that, or workload or apps that customers typically see as needing real-time data versus where maybe batches find?"}
{"doc_type": "earnings_call", "ticker": "CFLT", "period": "2023_Q4", "date": "2024-02-07", "section": "qa", "speaker": "Jay Kreps", "text": "Yes, it's a great question. I mean the key observation is, I think that everybody wants data to be up to date and they want things in sync with the business. The question is, how critical is that, right? Is that something that you must have at all costs? Is that something you would like to have? And I would say there's two changes there. First, increasingly, use cases do need that. As systems become more part of the operational stack of companies, as more of the use of data is driving action, not just reporting, I think that does require things to be much more in sync with the current state of the world and so I think there's a trend overall in that direction. And then secondly, the cost of real-time, the cost of streaming and the difficulty of it is very much coming in line with batch computing. There's no reason this should be harder. It's just newer. Right? And that takes time to mature. So, yes, we felt like, hey, without making a lot of really big assumptions, if you look at kind of what's the portion of workloads that the average enterprise would have on this streaming platform, I would say about a third, maybe a third live in this kind of operational database world where you're doing the quick lookups and serving the interactive web apps. Maybe a third are in the kind of analytics world, kind of back end batch stuff that just really doesn't need to move out of that kind of offline processing, and maybe a third are in that stream processing space. I think that's the end state that we're aiming for. If you look at companies that are a little more technologically advanced and have been at this for a while, that's where they are. If you look at companies who are just starting in this space, they just have a few things right that they've done. So the assumption is that those newcomers will be able to progress. What enables that is making this technology easy and approachable, which is, of course, the direction of all our investments."}

Obviously good execution here in Q4 and Rohan noted that new customer ads have increased in January, which is good to hear.

So like when we were thinking about the risks involved in this consumption transformation, that was definitely one of our potential risks, was like, hey, this is a big change for the sales team. What we've seen so far, I think has been very promising. So first of all, people understood why we were doing it. They felt like it was coming more in line with some of the pure companies and those companies have done it successfully. So I think there's enough kind of in the water that this makes sense. I think it's in line with what we see from customers, like what customers want to do. So I think it made sense to people. We've had a lot of conversations with bag carrying sales reps, sales leaders, at our sales kickoff last week and I was expecting a more mixed set of feedback. Usually if you make big changes, you get a little bit of everything. On the whole, I thought it was extremely positive so that's been good. And then attrition, that was one of our concerns. Overall, that's not been an issue. Attrition is under what we modeled for the year and in-line with historical norms for years when we hadn't had this change, so that's very positive."}

And I just wanted to pick up where Matt left off, just because I know that there's so much focus on this go to market transformation that you guys have been talking about. We're probably going to get this question. I just want to get it in a public forum here. But the concern, if we wanted to play devil's advocate, is that part of the Q4 strength was driven by, let's say, sales reps really trying to jam some of these contracts in under the old incentive structure. Can you just parse that out while we have everyone here to hear? I guess what you saw on that front?"}

I mean, first, it's important to understand that there's no change for Confluent Platform, the licensed software offering. Sales reps always want to get something done in the current year if they can, but there's no particular need to jam it through in 2023 versus 2024 on the Confluent platform side. On the Confluent Cloud side, it's very important to understand the revenue actually comes with the consumption. And so what you're seeing has nothing to do with the kind of deals closing that would show up in RPO, but the revenue represents just the increase in consumption, as you would expect. So, yes I don't think there was -- always people want to close deals as soon as they can, but I don't think there was a huge transition or kind of pull forward."}

And then a bit of a two part here, one to close out the sales and another just to the broader platform. The first, more just a financial checking here, but for Rohan, maybe you could give us a comment. But I think last quarter, the company had alluded to maybe 200 to 300 bps of an operating margin headwind based on the upfront expense recognition for Confluent Cloud with this incentive structure. Can you confirm that's still the case when we think about this guidance here for the year? And then the second part, again, this is coming back to you, Jay, but can you talk about the importance of Flink? And where I'm going with this is, I believe Flink actually generalizes the processing. Right? You can't handle both, streaming and batch processing. And again, for those folks who don't have the technical shots, myself included, but what is the importance of that generalization when we think about the potential that Flink has for your platform?"}

What we said last quarter was around just how commission is recognized and that had a 200 to 300 basis point headwind to our operating margins. That still holds good and that impact has actually been incorporated into our guide that we shared. So the seven percentage points improvement that we are talking about year-over-year takes into account that dynamic that's happening. So to you just confirm what you said, it's true."}

When people think about streaming, one of the mistakes I think they often make is to think of it as kind of a niche. Right? What's actually happened in the world to make this area successful is it's really kind of a generalization of the batch systems. And that's actually true in the Kafka layer where data is streamed, but it's actually stored permanently, if you like, as well. And it's true in the Flink layer, where data is processed in real-time but can also be reprocessed in batch. So it has actually a very sophisticated batch processing engine as well. And it's a bit into the tech weeds, but that ability to provide something, that's a generalization, that's actually key to the earlier point of what workloads would move. Why would they move? You want something that is as capable as fully featured, can handle the full set of workloads, but now does them continuously in sync with the business."}

Can you talk about the shape of the quarterly revenues in 2024 and any rough cut on impact of Flink and timing of impact from Flink?"}
{"doc_type": "earnings_call", "ticker": "CFLT", "period": "2023_Q4", "date": "2024-02-07", "section": "qa", "speaker": "Rohan Sivaram", "text": "Yes, I'll start with the second part. Jason, with respect to Flink, as we mentioned earlier, we expect to GA Flink in Q1. And with any kind of infrastructure product, it takes a couple of quarters for customers to start build the applications and use it. So as we said before, very consistent with what we've said before, we expect revenue, material revenue contributions from Flink to happen in fiscal year 2025. So that's on the Flink part. On the shape, I'll just call out a couple of things. I'm not going to guide or provide color commentary on every quarter, but in general, I think one thing I can give you some additional color is around the shape of the cloud business for 2024. In general, cloud as a percentage of total revenue for 2024, we expect to be in the range of 50% to 51%, which is kind of in line with where the estimates are. And of course, from a first half versus second half, what I've shared earlier is as a result of the consumption transformation, we're expecting second half growth rates to be slightly more elevated than first half. But as you can see from the guide, it's not a huge acceleration in that number. Hope that helps. Yes."}

So as you float the new consumption model and how salespeople are going to get compensated, what has been the customer feedback? Does it change anything about the way the customer is going to be dealing with the Confluent, regardless of the way you compensate your salespeople? And secondly, Jay, as you go into 2024, we're hearing a lot more Flink. The message Confluent is an elegant technology platform. It's pretty complicated, but it gets even more complicated as we get into discussion of where Flink fits in versus Kafka. How are we to navigate this complexity in the technology portfolio versus the complexity in the way we're going to be compensating salespeople? What are the tools and techniques you're giving your go to market organization to navigate and get through this complication? Thank you."}
{"doc_type": "earnings_call", "ticker": "CFLT", "period": "2023_Q4", "date": "2024-02-07", "section": "qa", "speaker": "Jay Kreps", "text": "Yes, on the first question, there's nothing immediate that changes in the interaction with customers, or at least not in a way that you would immediately notice. Right? So the payment model, the kind of business model that has all been consumption oriented since prior to the IPO, and so you might not notice anything if you're a customer, hopefully you notice that our field team is more helpful in finding the applications that are critical to your success, making sure that those get to production as quickly as possible. Hopefully they were doing that already, but the consumption incentive kind of directly drives that behavior. But it wouldn't be something where we have to send you some notice of something changing. It really is internal to our operations that the change is most apparent. On your second point, I think you will hear about complexity around Kafka or around Flink. I think it's actually very important to separate out the operational complexity of trying to build a big in house data system that you self-manage from actually using one of these cloud services. The interface to Kafka is very simple, kind of read and write data streams the interface for Flink is just SQL as people are used to. This is kind of the common language of databases or in other common programming languages, very similar constructs. So that developer interface is not complicated. If you want to stand up and build an in house data platform and run it yourself off the open source. Yes, there's a lot of rocket science involved in that. And so when we think about how does that affect our sales model? Well, that's part of what we're bringing, right. The value of these cloud platforms in particular is taking all that away. You can just depend on this as a service. And I do think that's where call it 90% of the complexity and this new stuff lies. And that's always been true. Like running databases is hard, running data systems of all kinds is hard, and this stuff is no different from that."}

What we track in Salesforce changes. We're now tracking the individual application workloads, not just the kind of high level contracts progressing. That's intentional. That lets us really explicitly drive that. And then, yes, there is a bit of a different motion and enablement around that. And so what have we done? We've rolled out these new systems, we've changed the compensation. We're kind of managing and driving this, we've run through the enablement. That was obviously a big focus in our sales kickoff. So does that mean everything's done, mission accomplished? Well, no. Now we have to go drive it successfully. Like any new thing. You got to put all the parts together, turn it into a car and drive the car. So that last bit is kind of the key focus this quarter, and next quarter is really making sure we nail that, that all of this works well in every territory for every rep everywhere in the world. That's obviously our focus. But in terms of like, well, what how do we feel relative to last quarter? As we talked about this well, obviously a number of things have derisked. Right? Like we rolled out this compensation program, I think it was successful. People understood it. They felt they could make money on this plan. We got the systems and tools built to run the business. So a lot of progress has been made, but there's obviously still a lot of work to do."}

Your net new logos were lighter than the typical Q4. Did the self-service activity really slow down and did the upcoming go to market transition to consumption factor into that? Also, it sounded like you had a nice bounce back in that new logos in January. And so, any additional color there would be helpful as well."}

I would say this one is mostly mechanical. And this is one where the consumption changes did have an impact in Q4. So one of the changes we made in Q4, we incented just kind of the bookings for cloud or platform. Starting in Q1, starting in January, we're directly incenting both land new logos and expand the kind of consumption off of it. So, yes, if you were going to close a very small new customer in late December, you might want to do it in January because you get paid on it. And so, yes, we did see a bit of a shift there. We're off to a good start, as we noted in the script in January. And then if we think about the trajectory over the rest of the year, we do think there's an opportunity to really drive a higher velocity land of customers. And that's part of our goal with this consumption transformation. So that's one of the areas we're going to be watching to try and see some like significant growth there. Over the course of the year."}

And then, Rohan, so your subscription gross margins continue to impress. And in fact, your total gross margins are now well above your prior or current, I should say, long-term guidance. Is there anything sort of one time in nature that's contained within gross margins today, or are you unlocking more efficiency than you maybe had expected previously?"}
{"doc_type": "earnings_call", "ticker": "CFLT", "period": "2023_Q4", "date": "2024-02-07", "section": "qa", "speaker": "Rohan Sivaram", "text": "No, Gregg, that's a right observation. When you look at our gross margins, we had record gross margins for total gross margins as well as subscription gross margins. And when you just kind of double click into it, the dynamics are as cloud mix over time increases. That's a headwind to gross margins. And during the same time, our engineering and product teams have done an incredible job in making sure they're improving the efficiency with which we delivering our products to our customers. And that's one driver. As we look ahead, I think there's an opportunity for us to drive a higher multitenant mix in our product, which is obviously going to be a tailwind to gross margins. So looking forward, we expect to be in the, I would say, zip code of 75 plus percent, which is our long term target, gross margins with some puts and takes. The tailwind is going to be more efficiencies coming through multitenant, and the headwind is going to be as cloud becomes a bigger piece of the mix. So we expect them to offset and be in this range that you see right now."}

I think you guys in the past have talked about Confluent cloud, 60% cheaper than self-managed open source. And we know there's over 100,000 companies using open source. Kafka, you think in this environment where there's more focus on spend efficiency, maybe you could see some kind of rising interest on the cloud side. So I guess as you move into 2024, are there any things you'd flag that you're doing to help drive more open source conversion?"}
{"doc_type": "earnings_call", "ticker": "CFLT", "period": "2023_Q4", "date": "2024-02-07", "section": "qa", "speaker": "Jay Kreps", "text": "Yes, it's a great observation. Yes, there's two key things. So I think the observation is right. There's like, excellent TCO. The two things that we think are critical to get right to raise the volume of conversions. One is this consumption transformation. One of the things that happened in 2023 was, I do think a lot of organizations tamped down on kind of bottom up purchasing. So the interplay between product led growth and the sales team suddenly becomes very important. And that's a key aspect of how we've kind of designed our plan for this year and how we've designed the consumption model for Confluent is to make sure that we have the right set up to land customers in our product, convert them over and kind of take them all the way with a little bit of help from the field team. And I think that's actually incredibly important in the infrastructure space if you want to be able to land volumes of customers. So that's the first change. The second change on our side is reducing the kind of friction of adoption. Some of that's technological. Just how easy is it to get from here to there? Like there may be some savings, but if I'm also reducing my team, do I have the people to actually make the change or make the switch? Part of that is just doing everything we can to make our product a drop in replacement, making it as easy to switch, making that kind of starting cost as appealing as possible, all of that matters a lot to make not just the payoff, but the payoff time really appealing."}

Did you see notable improvements in consumption in the quarter? Were you overly conservative in your guide?

Right? So when you look at puts and takes, the first piece I spoke about during in the prepared remarks was just the green shoots around digital native segment. That's a positive as we head into next year. And outside of that, when you look at our broader customer base in general, we felt the consumption came in line with our expectations and nothing unusual. And, that's probably the drivers of consumption. And as we enter next year, we were optimistic with respect to, as you can see in our Q1 guide."}

{"doc_type": "earnings_call", "ticker": "CFLT", "period": "2025_Q1", "date": "2025-04-30", "section": "prepared", "speaker": "Jay Kreps", "text": "Thanks, Shane. Good afternoon everyone, and welcome to our first quarter earnings call. We're pleased to start the year with solid momentum. Q1 subscription revenue grew 26% to $261 million, Confluent Cloud revenue grew 34% to $143 million, and non-GAAP operating margin improved six percentage points to 4%. Our Q1 results demonstrate the mission critical nature of data streaming, and our significant product leadership. We remain laser focused on enabling our customers, to cost efficiently build next generation applications and win in the age of AI. On today's call, I'd like to walk through four key strategic drivers, behind our resilience in the current environment. In fact, our resilience has been tested by multiple macro headwinds since Confluent's founding over 10 years ago, and it continues to support our path towards delivering long-term growth and profitability. First and most critically, data streaming sits at the heart of the mission critical use cases that, our customers rely on every day. These are not lightweight experiments, they're the backbone of real production workloads. These applications play a critical role in the day-to-day business of our customers, and can't be turned off without major disruption to core parts of their business. Confluent powers real-time fraud detection for financial institutions, inventory management for retailers, 5G networks for telcos, and data pipelines that power businesses in countless industries. This dynamic has helped sustain gross retention rate above 90%, despite multiple points of instability in the macro environment that, reduced IT spend for some of our customers. The second driver of our resilience is the scale of the opportunity we're going after. Apache Kafka has become a foundational technology for data management. Today it's used by more than 150,000 organizations representing $100 billion plus addressable market opportunity. Soaking up the countless use cases built on Kafka, has been a core engine of our growth, and continues to be a powerful tailwind. This quarter we added 340 new customers, our highest net add in three years, and we continue to see robust growth with many of our largest customers, as they expand to new use cases. In Q1, we added 16 new customers to our cohort of $1 million plus ARR customers, our highest addition to that cohort ever. Our customer base is diversified by industry and by geography, and no single customer accounts for more than 2% of our total ARR. This diversification further strengthens the resilience, and durability of our business. Audacy and Booking.com are two great examples of customers that started with open source and then converted to Confluent. Audacy is a leading audio entertainment company with 200 million listeners across radio broadcasts, podcasts and other digital content. As their audience grew and customer expectations rose, their old infrastructure began to hold them back. Developers were spending most of their time wrestling with brittle point-to-point integrations, built with open-source Kafka. These were difficult to manage and even harder to scale. Delivering new features at the pace the business needed, became a major challenge. That's when Audacy turned to Confluent. Our pre-built connectors allow them to easily integrate data streaming into their existing tools and systems. Stream governance enables them to quickly, and easily enforce data consistency across dozens of different systems and applications. With our complete data streaming platform, Audacy freed up developer resources so they can focus on innovation, instead of managing infrastructure. As a result, Audacy accelerated feature development by 40%, delivering more personalized experience that keep their customers listening. This helps unlock new digital revenue opportunities across their platform. Booking.com is one of the world's largest online travel agencies. Its mobile app is, one of the most downloaded travel agency apps in the world. Booking.com developed an in-house data streaming platform, based on open-source Kafka. However, self-managing Kafka became increasingly burdensome, as the company grew and introduced new use cases. Scaling clusters, handling updates and monitoring pipelines consumed significant resources. To alleviate the operational complexities of managing Kafka. Booking.com migrated each business unit's open-source clusters to Confluent platform. Our complete enterprise grade solution provided enhanced reliability, and out-of-the-box functionality. By spending less time managing infrastructure, Booking.com can now support various mission critical use cases more efficiently, including marketing, payments, personalization and core booking processes. With a complete data streaming platform that is connected across their business, they were also able to deploy, a connected trip experience. This allows customers to seamlessly book flights, accommodations, car rentals and experiences in one visit. The third driver of our resiliency is meeting customers wherever they are, whether that's on-prem on the edge in any cloud or hybrid environment. That flexibility also provides another layer of resilience to our business. It means our growth strategy is less exposed to changes in cloud investment, and provides a healthy mix of ratable and consumption-based revenue streams. Just as importantly, it lets us land and expand in environments where cloud isn't an option. Whether for regulatory reasons, company mandates or just customer preference. We continue to see strong momentum in this area. Our Confluent Platform business had a particularly strong quarter, with revenue growth accelerating to 18% year-over-year, representing its strongest Q1 growth in three years. And finally, it's not just that our products are better, faster and more reliable, they're also more cost effective. This is a strong differentiator, and provides our customers with more value for less money, across a wide range of use cases. Our low TCO enables us to expand usage, within our existing customer base, and also drive new conversions from open-source Kafka. It's one of the key levers that helps us retain customers, grow within our installed base, and tap into the broader open-source community in a meaningful way. Key to capitalizing on this TCO advantage, is offering pricing and packaging that fits the full range of Kafka use cases, from early projects to the most demanding production workloads. With new offerings like WarpStream and Freight clusters, we're now able to serve high throughput, low latency workloads at attractive price points, enabling our customers to tackle a wider range of use cases. We continue to see strong traction with both offerings in Q1, including new customers like Lyftoff.io and the next wave of GenAI companies like Cursor and Thinking Machines. Here's an example of how our TCO advantage drives sustained growth with a top 20 global bank. This $5 million plus ARR customer, who most recently increased their spend with us by over 30%, initially relied on open-source Kafka. However, the complexity and rising costs of self-managing Kafka quickly outweighed the value they received. More than five years ago, they migrated their first use case to Confluent. Since then, we've become a strategic partner as they've transitioned numerous legacy workloads to the cloud. Today, Confluent powers hundreds of use cases across their business like fraud detection, capital management, regulatory reporting of trade data and more. By moving to Confluent, they have significantly reduced operational costs, turned their real-time data into a competitive advantage and lowered their TCO. In fact, the customer believes that for every dollar they spend with Confluent, they would otherwise spend $3 managing Kafka themselves. Together, these four factors, mission critical use cases, open source conversion opportunities, hybrid business model and TCO advantages have laid the foundation, and made our business more resilient through multiple shifts in the macro environment. Additionally, we see continued adoption of our DSP components, which significantly outgrew our core cloud business. Confluent unifies everything organizations need to work with real-time data, the ability to stream, connect, process and govern continuously flowing streams of data all in one platform. This foundation is proving especially valuable as generative AI moves from experimentation to execution. In particular, we're seeing strong interest and adoption for Flink and Tableflow, two of the most recent additions to our DSP. Our complete platform, is becoming the connective tissue that brings real time context to our customers' GenAI applications so they can deliver trustworthy and actionable results that work in everyday operations. It's very exciting to see what our DSP enables our customers to do. For example, a leading luxury goods conglomerate with 75 brands and over 6,000 stores worldwide uses our Confluent Cloud for Apache Flink to power its real-time order management and drive e-commerce growth. The company initially turned to Confluent Cloud to stream order management data to give internal teams, accurate real-time visibility into product availability. As Confluent proved its value with this first use case, the customer consumed more of our platform, including our fully managed Flink service, to prevent inaccurate stock information caused by duplicate data. This customer uses Flink to filter out orders and inventory duplicates, and to continuously analyze real-time product availability. When high demand items come back in stock, Flink automatically triggers real-time alerts to notify waiting customers, enhancing the customer experience and driving incremental revenue. Building on the success of their initial Flink use case, they are now exploring new ways to leverage the technology, to streamline and scale product inventory management. Before closing, I'm excited to share two updates. First, Ryan Mac Ban has been promoted to Chief Revenue Officer at Confluent. In this expanded role, Ryan will lead the global field strategy, bringing together sales, sales engineering, customer success, and sales operations to help customers activate real-time data to build the next wave of intelligent applications. Ryan joined Confluent last year as Senior Vice President, Global Head of Sales. He brings over 20 years of sales leadership experience, building and leading top-performing teams around the world. Before Confluent, Ryan was President, UiPath Americas, where he drove significant growth across their multi-product platform. He's also held senior leadership roles at VMware and Cisco. Second, we're honored to be named a Google Partner of the Year for the sixth time. This recognition is a reflection of the strong partnerships, we have with the leading CSPs. Together, we enable organizations to deliver the next generation applications they need to thrive in the age of AI. In closing, we're proud of our strong start to the year. Our commitment to providing the industry's most complete data streaming platform, paired with a highly resilient business, uniquely positions Confluent to seize the $100 billion plus data streaming market. With that, I'll turn it over to Rohan."}
{"doc_type": "earnings_call", "ticker": "CFLT", "period": "2025_Q1", "date": "2025-04-30", "section": "prepared", "speaker": "Rohan Sivaram", "text": "Thanks Jay. Good afternoon everyone, and thank you for joining our earnings call. Our first quarter performance underscores the strength of our mission critical data streaming platform. The strategic value of our multi-cloud, multi-data destination and multi-deployment approach as well as the flexibility of our well diversified growth strategy. Turning to the results, Q1 subscription revenue grew 26% to $260.9 million, exceeding the high end of our guidance, and representing 96% of total revenue. Confluent Platform revenue reached a new record of $118.2 million, with growth accelerating to 18%. This momentum was driven by early traction in our partner ecosystem, where OEM showed particular strength internationally. Cloud revenue grew 34% to $142.7 million, representing 55% of subscription revenue. The revenue impact of lapping the leap year, was approximately negative $1.6 million as Q1, this year had one fewer day for consumption. Turning to the geographical mix of total revenue, revenue from the U.S. grew 23% to $156.4 million. Revenue growth from outside the U.S. grew 28% to $114.7 million. Moving on to rest of the income statement, I'll be referring to non-GAAP results unless stated otherwise. While driving top line growth at scale, we continued to show significant operating leverage in our model. In Q1, subscription gross margin increased 100 basis points to 81.7%, primarily driven by continued efficiency gain in Confluent Cloud, coupled with strength in Confluent Platform. Operating margin was 4.3% and exceeding our guidance of approximately 3%, and was primarily driven by revenue and gross margin outperformance. Adjusted free cash flow margin, which excluded the non-recurring impact of our compensation change in Q1, was 1.8%. The impact of the change to free cash flow margin in Q1, was approximately 14 percentage points. Net income per share was $0.08 using 367.8 million diluted weighted average shares outstanding. Fully diluted share count under the treasury stock method was approximately 380.9 million. We ended the first quarter with $1.92 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. Turning now to customer metrics, we ended Q1 with approximately 6,140 customers, representing a sequential increase of 340 customers, our highest sequential increase since Q1 of 2022. This robust growth underscores the strong value proposition of our multiproduct platform, and our continued success in capturing the open-source conversion opportunity. As mentioned, at Investor Day 2025, we will report total customer count on an annual basis and begin reporting 20,000 plus ARR customers on a quarterly basis. In Q1, 20,000 plus ARR customer count increased to 2,487 up 41 customers sequentially and represented more than 95% of our ARR. Our 100,000 plus ARR customer count increased to 1,412, up 31 customers sequentially and accounted for greater than 90% of our ARR. Our $1 million plus ARR customer count grew to 210, up 16 customers sequentially our best quarter in net add for this cohort. NRR for the quarter remained stable at 117%, while GRR continued to be greater than 90%, demonstrating the mission critical nature of our data streaming platform for our customers. Turning to our outlook for the fiscal second quarter of 2025, we expect subscription revenue to be in the range of $267 million to $268 million, representing growth of approximately 19%. Non-GAAP operating margin to be approximately 5%, and non-GAAP net income per diluted share to be in the range of $0.08 to $0.09. For fiscal year 2025, we expect subscription revenue to be in the range of $1.1 billion to $1.11 billion, representing growth of approximately 19% to 20%. Non-GAAP operating margin to be approximately 6%, and non-GAAP net income per diluted share, to be approximately $0.36. Now, I'd like to provide some additional context for our guidance along with a few modeling points. In light of the uncertainties in the current environment, we are widening our revenue guidance range and embedding a modest decline in growth rates, from Q2 through Q4. For our cloud business, some of our larger customers began slowing the pace of new use case addition and focusing on cost optimization efforts in March. In contrast, consumption activities in our smaller customer base remain stable. These trends have continued into April. Given the current macro conditions, we believe it's prudent to assume there will not be a near term rebound in consumption. This contrasts with previous cycles, where we typically saw a subsequent expansion following a period of slower consumption. As a result, we now expect cloud subscription revenue mix to be approximately 58% for Q4, '25, with a sequential mix increase of approximately one point each quarter. Finally, we expect fiscal year '25, adjusted free cash flow margin to be approximately 6%. This excludes, as previously discussed, a one-time headwind of three to four percentage points for the full year, due to our compensation change in Q1. We are confident that our updated guidance coupled with multiple parts to growth, sets us up for success this year. Specifically, we see four key drivers of growth in our business. First, the core streaming conversion opportunity targeting an open-source installed base, of over 150,000 organizations. Second, our DSP upsell opportunities across connect, process, govern and Tableflow. Third, our highly strategic role in the age of AI, as traditional enterprises accelerate AI adoption. We believe this represents our largest monetization opportunity within AI. And fourth, the leverage we gain from our expanding partner ecosystem including the OEMs, SIs, MSPs and other high impact strategic partnerships that, help us extend our global reach and accelerate go-to-market efforts. It's important to note these aren't just cloud only growth vectors. We believe they represent durable growth drivers, for both Confluent Cloud and Confluent Platform. For example, in Q1 revenue outperformance was driven by on-prem momentum, with Confluent Platform and its critical role in closing large enterprise deals, with our OEM partners. Our well diversified growth strategy, gives us resilience and flexibility, enabling us to continue to drive durable and profitable growth. In closing, our first quarter results are a testament to the resilience of our business and our ability to capture our market opportunity. With a large TAM category-defining technology and an exceptional team, we are firmly positioned to sustain long-term growth and profitability. Now, Jay and I will take your questions."}

One obviously macro has been top of mind for everybody. I think you said you've seen some slowdown in new use cases, across large customers. Wanted to ask you what about existing kind of use cases, the consumption run rate there? Because I would assume that the existing use cases probably drives a bigger portion of revenue than, kind of the ramping of new use cases, right. And also from the ACV commitment standpoint, are you seeing any difference so far in April, which makes you to kind of look at the guidance?"}

So overall what we said, is that we did see a bit of lower consumption in our larger customers on the cloud side. And so overall good quarter, strong growth in CP, solid growth in cloud. This was a combination of optimizations and slower addition of new use cases. I would say both, that wasn't across the customer base, you know, in our smaller customers we didn't see that pattern. And it wasn't specific to a single segment, either in terms of international distribution, or industry. I wouldn't attribute that directly to macro. I think the way I would explain it is this, right? We've seen a bit of an oscillating pattern in these larger customers, where they tend to have kind of a cycle of optimization, and then additional growth and optimization and growth in times that were a bit more certain. We would probably bake in the assumption that that pattern would continue, and we'd see more of a rebound given the current environment. We don't want to do that. We want to be a little bit more conservative in how we're looking at that, and just kind of play it forward straight through the year. And that's what we've done when we've constructed the guidance for this year. Rohan, you may have more to add to that."}

Pinjalim, I'll take the second part of your question on the commitments as you can see, from our RPO numbers, Q1 was strong. Both on the CP side where we saw multiyear deals, customers committing multiple multiyear deals. Also on the cloud side, where our cloud motion continues to be consumption first. But we've seen a lot of customers actually come and commit to multiyear deals on the cloud side as well. So the ACV commitments in Q1 was strong. That's how I'd categorize it."}

And this is more of a high level. We have seen some enthusiasm in the open-source community around this idea of a diskless Kafka. Seems like with a new KIP around there, obviously that's writing directly to object storage. And WarpStream has been doing that for some time now in your own WarpStream. So I want to ask you, how do you kind of see the future of Confluent? Is Confluent overall as a whole, not just WarpStream, could it move to a diskless future at some point? Or the latency issues kind of with object storage kind of might...?"}

Yes, we've actually done that in both our cloud and with WarpStream. We're actually very intelligent about the use of storage. And so our Freight clusters use kind of a pure diskless approach. Our other clusters use a combination of storage technologies across the memory hierarchy to optimize it. There's a fair amount of sophistication in that layer, and it actually matters a lot when you think about the cost characteristics and the performance tradeoffs. It's definitely an area we put a fair amount of R&D effort."}

Congrats on the quarter environment at all. Jay, it was great to hear the success in DSP. I think you called out Flink and Tableflow in particular. I'm just sort of curious, 4Q you called out DSP was 13% of your cloud business. I'm wondering if you can sort of quantify how that improved sequentially. And then maybe just a little bit more on Flink, it seems to be coming up more and more in our partner checks. I'm wondering where you're seeing some of the option there?"}
{"doc_type": "earnings_call", "ticker": "CFLT", "period": "2025_Q1", "date": "2025-04-30", "section": "qa", "speaker": "Jay Kreps", "text": "Yes. I'll give you some characterization. Our intention with that kind of DSP percentage is to come back to that periodically but not every single quarter. And so, here's what we're seeing. So ton of enthusiasm. Overall like sentiment in the company is the DSP offerings are on great success trajectory, significantly outgrowing the kind of core cloud business. And we've been through this before. As that stuff starts to get to scale, it moves the overall numbers. And a lot of enthusiasm from customers. We just released Tableflow as GA in AWS. Great early signs for that. And then Flink is succeeding really nicely both in the cloud as well as in CP. We've added this to our CP offering and picked up some really sizable customers on that doing awesome use cases. And so I think this is still the early innings for the offerings on both sides, but great initial success. In the cloud, these kind of serverless offerings, you start with kind of a broad base of simple use cases, then you start to build to the more mission-critical, large conversions where people are moving dozens, or hundreds of different processing jobs over. And that's, of course, when you start to see the real money move - and we're starting to win some of those kind of larger customer engagements. We're putting in a ton of work to make sure we can really deliver against these big migrations, and that's a real focus in the team. But overall, do you think that there's a significant push inside companies towards real-time in the use of data? We're seeing this pattern around, we would call it shifts left, where a lot of what customers were doing with data is moving upstream into the real-time area so that it can go to multiple destinations, so that it can land in their analytics environments faster and so that it can be part of the use of AI applications, which often need that. And for all those reasons, I think we have great tailwinds in that area. We ultimately don't make a ton of that product success into our guidance. It's often hard to forecast these new things, something like Tableflow that's just coming out to GA right now. We would have internal goals, but when we think about our financial plan for the year, we wouldn't have something attached to that until we really see it perform. But the initial signs are very promising in terms of build the pipeline and customer conversations."}

I think the reduced guidance makes a lot of sense to us just given the macro. I appreciate the conservatism there. Coming off of a record quarter, at least from the past several years of new customer adds, I'm wondering how you're thinking about the relative rate of customer adds versus NRR. I mean, are you assuming that, that NRR comes down a little bit, new customer adds? Just kind of the components of that would be helpful?"}
{"doc_type": "earnings_call", "ticker": "CFLT", "period": "2025_Q1", "date": "2025-04-30", "section": "qa", "speaker": "Rohan Sivaram", "text": "Yes. Matt, sure thing. I mean I'll make a couple of comments on guidance, and then I'll get to your question on NRR and customer count. I mean, as we called out, our guidance philosophy has been very consistent. And how we've approached it is disciplined approach, and set prudent targets. And Jay talked about the dynamic around consumption. On the CP side, we did see good momentum in Q1. Our visibility for Q2 remains good. So that's kind of driving our outlook for Q2, and rest of the year. But if I take a step back and look at the guidance, what I'll tell you is we're looking at a guidance of 19% to 20% for the year at $1 billion-plus scale. And we're doing that with what I would call a fairly prudent setup for us. And we have multiple vectors of growth as we look at it, which includes streaming, which includes DSP, the AI as well as the partner ecosystem. So that's a little bit about the guidance, and why we feel good with the setup that we have right now. To your question around customer count, that's right. I mean that entire ecosystem of customer count, not only total customers on one bookend, but also $1 million-plus customers, we had the best quarter from $1 million-plus customers that tells you that top of the funnel, obviously, we are adding a lot of customers into the Confluent ecosystem. Our $20,000 customer tell you the amount of, I would say, high-intensity, high-frequency customers who can spend a lot with us. That shows the core customer count. And $1 million-plus customers is just how we are pushing them through the funnel. So overall, we feel good. NRR last couple of quarters has been, give or take, around 117% range. And what supports that NRR is our consistency on the GRR side. That's call-out number one. We've been greater than 90% since we've been a public company. And on the expansion side, the dynamics that we called out on the consumption side could have an impact. But if I think about NRR, it should be in that ZIP code of 117% as we look ahead."}

I appreciate you taking the questions. Jay, I want to start with something that was, I think, very topical at the Investor Day, which was just some of the AI-related use cases. You've mentioned Cursor a couple of times. Investor sentiment on this topic, certainly, it seems to ebb and flow. But can you just help add some context around what you're seeing in terms of AI-related demand, if there are certain use cases, you're finding you'll have strong product market fit as those evolve, and just how we should start to expect some of this to evolve, over a longer period of time?"}

So we've seen success kind of in two dimensions in the AI area. I mean, first, selling to AI companies like Cursor, as you mentioned. The other is the kind of enterprise uses of AI, where we're really fulfilling two roles. One is this data supply chain for getting the data that fulfills the context for some of these AI applications. The second is for these agents that, are actually acting on things in real-time. The usage - the more sophisticated use of data has often been some batch job at the end of the day. But the point of these agents is to get into the kind of real-time flow of things. And we are starting to see those use cases emerge. I would say that's earlier of the two. But I think it's a pattern that's quite durable. We've done a fair amount of writing, and kind of thought leadership in this area. And we're seeing kind of a community of interest forming around this in our customer base, and well beyond in the larger community. So I think that's very promising."}

Just beyond the consumption patterns in terms of some of the things you're contemplating with guidance, it sounds like newer products are just lower assumptions in the earlier stage.

And then on the go-to-market transition, maybe just help us with what you've seen from Ryan and how you're thinking about the shape of productivity you could see throughout the year?"}

Any of these executive roles, we obviously do very broad outside search, and look inside as well and met a lot of people in the process. And I felt internally, we had somebody who had a ton of strength in execution. He was a strategic thinker and understood, what we were doing as a business, the space we were operating in. He would be an awesome part of the executive team, and leadership of the company. So I feel really good about the changes. Obviously, also less disruptive, because you have somebody who's already managing the full set of sales reps, just kind of taking on additional responsibility. And you have somebody who kind of proven themselves on the field, versus taking a shot on somebody new coming in and adjusting to our space. So I feel really good about that, and excited about what we can do in the year ahead. Obviously, less changes overall on the go-to-market side this year than last year, as last year, we were doing this bigger set of consumption changes. So I think overall, that's a positive setup for us. And then remind me of the other part of the question."}

The two things that I think are in our mind, we're - we've started to get this Connect business scale, the business around the connectors. We're now able to do much more of the kind of lift and shift of existing use of open-source Kafka Connect and bring that into our platform. We feel pretty good about that motion. So now it's kind of taken that to scale. For Flink, it really is about these larger customers and use cases. Taking the - any kind of cloud layer that does data processing is basically a programming framework, where you're writing effectively complete program, SQL or Java, and the ability for customers to take things that they've done, to migrate in and really get to scale with that across big complicated production use cases. As we start to make more of those successful more quickly, that's kind of the motion to start bringing more and more, onto the cloud offering there. CP Flink, I think, is of a nice start with customers. That's kind of an easier process of lift and shift. And then Tableflow is just out of the starting gates. So the big milestones there are getting it across all the clouds, opening up the integration with Delta and Unity. The Databricks technologies that we've kind of promised to our customers and are working with Databricks around. Both of those are exciting milestones. I think we'll start to see that get out to early customers and have a better sense of the trajectory in the coming quarters."}

As we sort of enter this period of uncertainty, it sounds like the business coming in is quite healthy, and really impressive customer add metrics across the board. One of the things I'm trying to get a handle, or we're all trying to get a handle on is that if optimization activity comes back online, how to compare it maybe do what we saw in the back half of 2022, throughout 2023, when there was kind of a more widespread optimization activity across the customer base. So in that spirit, Jay, I was wondering if you could talk about maybe the profile of the business back then in the second half of '22 and '23, versus what's driving growth in your customer base today. And if we did see another round of optimization activity, how would you compare it versus the last cycle?"}

I would say that probably the biggest change in the business between those two time frames is I do think customers have done a lot of this. When you think about effectively what we went through in '19, '20, '21, there's kind of a run-up in cloud spend and a big push on just build, build, build, new stuff, new stuff, new stuff. And in that environment, you do get a lot of effectively unoptimized cloud usage in a variety of ways. And probably the companies with a consumption model as we have for our cloud, saw the run-up of that the fastest. And then, of course, also in that consumption model, it's easier than for - the customers should be able to make sure they're really getting the full value out of it, and that will take down the spend. I think the difference now is a lot of that has been done, right? So we do see refinement in customer usage. But I don't think that there's nearly as much of a - I think there's a lot more tightness in the base of the cloud usage, than there was at that time period."}

And so picking up on the strong Confluent Platform performance, the acceleration of 18%, I was wondering if you sort of view that as a structural change as some of the knock-on effects from some of the policies - the macro policies that have - the policy debate around customers toggling a little bit more to self-managed given potential actions on digital services, those types of things. And so do you see Confluent Platform and some of the innovation around CP Flink is that now more, of a better grower for the product portfolio, in your view?"}
{"doc_type": "earnings_call", "ticker": "CFLT", "period": "2025_Q1", "date": "2025-04-30", "section": "qa", "speaker": "Jay Kreps", "text": "Yes. I think it's too early to say to make that. What we saw in Q1 was actually just really good performance in CP. I don't think - those deals obviously have some time line to build. So it wasn't directly in relation to tariffs, or anything like that, as you that quickly. So what we have seen, I think, is probably a ton of exuberance about cloud-heavy investment and I would say maybe a more measured cloud and on-premise strategy in some of the larger enterprises. And what you're seeing is relevant, right, which is, hi, if companies are internationally are more concerned about the interaction with the U.S., could there be more pressure on cloud usage? It's certainly possible. I mean I don't see any kind of major pullback from the cloud, but it's certainly possible. The one thing I would say is Confluent has intentionally built to be highly resilient across that. And so to some extent, we're not taking a hard bet on one side or the other. We've continued to invest in Confluent Platform. We've continued to add functionality. There wasn't as much growth in data center usage for a period of time. If there's a bit more, CP will probably grow a bit faster. If that's not the case, cloud will grow faster. We're basically happy to support customers wherever they are. I don't - I wouldn't expect a large scale pullback from the cloud just, because we've, as an industry, kind of come to just rely so heavily on it. So I think it'd be premature to call any of that. But the key point for us, making sure we're in a great place with customers one way or the other. And I will tell you that this ability, to serve customers multi-cloud and hybrid has become really top of mind for a lot of these companies. As they are just starting to think about the balance of investment, what they're doing, what's happening with some of the legacy stacks, et cetera, I think that's turned into a real asset and with it. Maybe four years ago, it was more hypothetical. Now it's just a very concrete must-have."}

When you look at our $1 million-plus customers today and we added net 16 customers, the highest we've had, the mix of that is very balanced across our portfolio. For example, like seven of those customers were driven by CP expansions are driven by CP. And then 50% of them are currently hybrid customers. And 13 out of those 16 customers actually had DSP in it. So fairly balanced. And I think that's something that, we feel good about."}

At this point, we really have a leadership - product leadership, I think of the cloud, product leadership on-premise and a really good hybrid story.

I wanted to follow-up on Sanjit's question. I mean such a strong CP quarter out of the gate here in Q1. And I think within that term license is up like 60% year-on-year. And if I listen carefully to your comments, Rohan, in the prepared remarks, you mentioned the OEM relationships in international. I don't typically think of you guys as a strong OEM company, maybe not like Microsoft, but maybe I'm just not listening well enough. Can you just expand a little bit more on the nature of these types of relationships, the visibility you have to these deals, the typical term length? And what is the better-together story with these type of relationships?"}

From an overall CP business perspective, as you rightly called out, Q1 was a strong quarter, 18% growth. But I've said this before for CP. I think looking at this business over a 12-month period is actually a much better indicator. Typically, timing of some of these larger deals, timing of these renewals, which are large could have an impact on revenue. But if you look at it from a 12-month lens, you'll see the consistency in the CP performance. And historically, we've called out strength from regulated industries. And over the last couple of quarters, we've been talking about our focus around the partner ecosystem. And some of these OEM deals, I think, in a very simple manner, it just helps us amplify our message, and send basically sell through as well through a lot of our OEM partners. So this particular OEM that we called out, was primarily on the international side, which was strength. But it's not just from OEM. It's also from multiyear deals that we also had in Q1. And as we look at the rest of the year, I think the visibility is, we'll see a good momentum in CP for rest of the year primarily, because of the reasons that Jay just laid out."}

The folks entering the $1 million-plus is obviously a different explanation from that kind of top-of-the-funnel total customer count adds. At that top-of-the-funnel side, I would say we've made a set of improvements in the product-led side of the business, and we feel like that has kind of picked up a little bit of steam. On the $1 million-plus side, it really is just customers continuing to progress in their streaming journey and helping them along. It's rare that companies start there. They usually start a bit smaller and grow into it. So that's just an evolution usually of work we've been doing with them over a year, multiyear, really depending on the case."}

We have customers who are car companies or retailers, and they're thinking about this. And I think the answer is they're not sure, and I haven't seen the action yet. But certainly, when we're thinking about our guidance, the trajectory for the rest of the year, it makes us more cautious, and conservative in what we're doing."}

Is it fair to think that with your - the traction you're seeing with your partner ecosystem, CP, this is, call it, an incremental growth vector here just, because certain geographies have a preference, or a greater desire to go for CP over cloud?"}
{"doc_type": "earnings_call", "ticker": "CFLT", "period": "2025_Q1", "date": "2025-04-30", "section": "qa", "speaker": "Rohan Sivaram", "text": "Yes. Mike, I mean, when I think about the growth drivers for us, called out four growth drivers. The streaming opportunity DSP, which is not only net new, but also expansion to our existing customers, AI as well as the partner ecosystem, which includes SIs, GSIs, OEMs, these are all not only Confluent Cloud, but they are also Confluent Platform opportunities. So I think that's probably one thing that I wanted to call out, I also called out in my prepared remarks. So short answer to your question is yes, it's across the board. And our strategy around being the partner ecosystem, Switzerland, where multi-data destination, multi-cloud and also multi-form factor, is helping in the current environment."}

Jay, wondering if you could give us an update on WarpStream. Since acquiring the company, have you been able to close any meaningful transactions? And if so, has all of that come from the WarpStream pipe? Or was some of this Confluent-generated as you start to integrate it into the fold of the rest of the go-to-market, so to speak?"}

So we've definitely had some really nice strong wins. I think we've shared a few of those. We've mentioned Cursor, but there's been a set of others that we brought forward in some of the past earnings. And yes, those are a mixture of some things that were - a few that were already in the pipeline, but we're actually seeing great activity and a set of wins across the larger team. And it's not surprising. This is something that was very close to home, fill the kind of natural niche in our product portfolio, and was ready to sell. And so, we kind of knew coming in to be one that could potentially hit the ground running, and that's what we've seen."}

And then just for Rohan, as part of the revised 2025 guide, you mentioned you're not assuming a near-term rebound in consumption. But maybe if we were to look at the other side of the coin, I'm just curious if any thought was given to assuming a further weakening of these trends just given greater unpredictability of the macro. Or from where you sit, from your perspective, does it just seems difficult to envision things degrading from here?"}
{"doc_type": "earnings_call", "ticker": "CFLT", "period": "2025_Q1", "date": "2025-04-30", "section": "qa", "speaker": "Rohan Sivaram", "text": "Yes. I think the way we thought about it was, again, make sure that we have a prudent setup for rest of the year. So what are the two big assumptions behind it? We spoke about it, but I'll reiterate it because it's important. First, for our larger cloud customers, we know we did see some cost optimization slowdown in net new use cases. We are not assuming an immediate near-term rebound in their consumption patterns. If you compare and contrast that with history, we've seen that - historically, we've seen a rebound after optimization pattern. And you've got us call out the sawtooth pattern that we see. We're not assuming that same shape. That by itself provides some prudence to our guide as we look forward the year. For Confluent Platform, it's slightly different because, of course, as Jay mentioned, there are deals that are already in the works. You have visibility into the pipeline. You have - so our guide is based on a lot of visibility in the pipeline that, we have from Confluent Platform. And I think, the final takeaway from my perspective is, if we take a step back and you look at our guide, we're calling 19% to 20% at a greater than $1 billion run rate. But we're not assuming any form of acceleration in the back half of the year. I think that setup makes us feel good, as we head into what I'd call uncertain times, yes."}

I'll start with Jay. Anything to share around what kind of demand reception you've seen from Tableflow since it went GA? And just curious how to think about the revenue benefits. Is there a separate charge for Tableflow? Or is it more about just bringing new workloads onto the core platform?"}
{"doc_type": "earnings_call", "ticker": "CFLT", "period": "2025_Q1", "date": "2025-04-30", "section": "qa", "speaker": "Jay Kreps", "text": "Yes. It's a great question. So the reception has been extremely strong. Now it's difficult, of course, for new products to figure out exactly how fast it will ramp, and exactly to what size. So we're always cautious, when we try and forecast anything around it. But I'd say, overall, it's about as strong as we've ever seen for any new product, and we're very excited about it. It will take us some time to get it across all the clouds, and across all the different formats to fully open up and capitalize on the opportunity. That will happen over the course of this year. It is priced separately. So there's additional charges directly for the Tableflow usage. But actually, the bigger opportunity in what we've seen with customers is, yes, they actually start to bring new data sets on entirely, right? So they'll spend some on Tableflow, but they'll spend some on Connect and Kafka and Flink along with that. And so, the opportunity is really on both sides. And I think, one of the reasons we're particularly excited about it is, it's a very easy product to enable. For existing data, you can kind of just turn it on. It doesn't require a ton of development work. And so, we feel like, hi, as we really crack this and learn how to take it to market, it will be something that we can ramp relatively quickly. But of course, we have to first get it to GA and all the clouds, and make it fully available over the course of this year to be able to do that."}

And then, Rohan, I mean, thanks for the color on the change in guidance assumptions. I wanted to ask about the government side of things. First, could you give us a sense of kind of how big of a business public sector, or U.S. Fed is? And then, maybe talk about pipelines, and how you may have changed your assumptions in the second half of this year, given all the new developments on the DOGE side of things?"}

When we think about the government opportunity, I always put the government opportunity in the category of the opportunities ahead of us, because it's fairly underpenetrated. For context, our exposure to the federal government is in the low single-digits, so immaterial. And the shape of the business is consistent with what you see in other companies. Q3 tends to be a stronger Fed quarter. And some of these data points are baked into the guidance that we've set. So short answer, it's obviously fairly underpenetrated, big opportunity. And we spoke about getting FedRAMP status from a technology perspective. Now we are working with our government partner, to get formal FedRAMP status. That will obviously open up the cloud business for us with the government is. So that's how we're thinking about it, small but..."}

One, Rohan, as you thought about the guidance, you mentioned more of the larger accounts have the issues. How do I think about that? Like in theory, this could play out two ways. So the larger account just do a little bit and then it's all good again, or it kind of goes down deeper into large accounts are first and then SMB has a problem. So when you thought about guidance, how would you kind of thought about that kind of reflecting that? And then one for Jay, if you think about - obviously, there were kind of movements from other players in the broader ecosystem to think more about acquisitions in your space. Did you see anything in the customer conversations that they realized, okay, real time is a lot more important, people are trying to keep it out? Are you seeing the benefit on that conversation that they realize, okay, you are actually in the real-time company, so I should talking more with you?"}
{"doc_type": "earnings_call", "ticker": "CFLT", "period": "2025_Q1", "date": "2025-04-30", "section": "qa", "speaker": "Jay Kreps", "text": "Yes. To the second part of the question, I do think that there's definitely been a change in the perception of streaming. I wouldn't say it's a step change. I mean the - in our space, I feel like people always expect there to be a single event that triggers it, but what we've actually seen is a real build, where this went for something that was viewed as kind of niche and on the side, like what could you really do with it? Just something that, of course, every company is doing, but isn't necessarily part of the top line strategy, just something that's really like a major part of data strategy. And I think these kind of things always help that along, but there's no one event that kind of goes from 0% to 100%. And so yes, certainly that comes up in conversations with the customers. I don't think it's a huge catalyst, on that in terms of how they're thinking about things. But there's no question that just - if I were to just kind of go back on two-year increments, and describe what does the conversation with the average CIO seem like? It kind of went from nothing what is any of the stuff to like, okay, Apache Kafka, yes, but like why does it matter? And what is Confluent to like really a broader appreciation of what's possible with streaming, what Confluent is, what could potentially be doable in the stream processing world as they think about kind of the real-time use of data. And that's not universal. It's not everybody has that understanding, but just more broadly across the industry that's changing. And I think it's a really powerful thing. When you think about - there's a certain inevitability to the move to streaming and real-time data. It's sort of just aspect of how companies are changing. And I do think that, that benefits us."}

And Raimo, to your first part of the question, for our smaller customers, or not larger customers, our consumption patterns have been fairly steady. And that's a good news. And also, when you look at the net new customer adds that we have, a vast majority of our top-of-the-funnel net new ads come on the cloud side. So that is a steady stream of consumption customers flowing in. So the variation in that middle segment is a lot less. So that's why we feel good, with the outlook that we have for rest of the year."}

And kind of adding to that a little color, it's like when you look behind the curtains, kind of customer-by-customer and the large customers, it's like, okay, is there some pattern or some big event that's taking place? Is there any reason to believe that would kind of spread? There's really not. It's just kind of the normal like customer activity you would see around infrastructure and optimization. And of course, the smaller customers do just have a certain law of large numbers in terms of how they operate. So yes, we don't see any kind of emerging trend there. When we put the pattern together, we certainly saw very strong pipe gen in the quarter. So kind of that top of funnel of what's coming in is really good. So we didn't see some kind of overall systematic softening, of the demand environment, or anything like that."}

It's certainly the case that we feel that the addition to the product portfolio to the other Kafka SKUs that kind of filling gaps in DSP that over time, that's a tailwind because we can land and convert more of the existing Kafka. We can turn these into bigger use cases, bigger platforms, a bigger spend customer by customer. The new product things are still smaller. So they move the overall numbers a little bit and grow fast on a percentage basis. As they get to scale, they move the overall numbers a lot. And we've been through a few of those curves before with the ramp of our cloud product and other things. And so yes, that's kind of the way we look at it. We watch these new things very closely, to make sure that they're on the ramp that we want. And we would expect to see that, kind of have broad impact as they get to scale."}

Q3 represented another quarter of solid results with total revenue growth of 18.1%, driven by our differentiated value proposition of providing the most modern software in the industry, continuing to resonate in the market, particularly among the next generation of workers. With Gen Z set to overtake baby boomers as the dominant generation in the workforce this year, we have continued to invest in meeting the needs and expectations of the modern workforce to deliver the most integrated and intuitive experience in the industry. Most recently, we released a number of new enhancements to our talent acquisition suite to help our clients recruit, train and retain members of the next-generation workforce. In particular, our new text to scan and two-way texting features will better enable recruiters to directly communicate with candidates and receive key metrics on engagements, visits, application rates and higher data in real time. Additionally, new AI-driven smart groups within community will help new hires automatically integrate into their teams, promoting collaboration and integration. All of these new features are accessible directly via our top-rated mobile app, which enables employees to stay connected, access essential information and contribute effectively from anywhere. Our commitment to product development also continues to be recognized in the market with Paylocity recently placing as an overall leader in 10 product categories in the G2 Spring 2024 Grid reports. Additionally, Paylocity ranked number two overall on TrustRadius' 2024 Most Loved List. And once again, listed as top 10 HR Solution in G2's 2024 Best Software Awards.

Solid sales and operational execution in Q3 helped drive our total revenue to $401.3 million or 18.1% growth over Q3 of last year, beating the high-end of our guidance by $2.3 million. We remain confident in our sales team and go-to-market motion as well as our strong competitive position in the market, and we continue to be pleased with our top of funnel activity and how – are resonating in the market. While we continue to see elongated sales cycles at the high-end of our market during the quarter, we remain focused on driving sales rep and go-to-market productivity in Q4 and into fiscal 2025. We also saw another strong quarter of channel performance as channel referrals, primarily from benefit brokers and financial advisers, once again represented more than 25% of new business for the third quarter as we continue to leverage the strong source of referrals. Our topline performance, coupled with continued operational efficiency helped drive adjusted EBITDA of $167.9 million or 41.8% margin, which exceeded the high-end of our guidance by $11.4 million. Lastly, Q3 represents our busiest time of year as we work to support our clients through other year-end processing and annual tax form filings. I'd like to say a huge thank you to our more than 6,000 employees who live and represent our values every day and who work so hard to support our clients. The strong culture at Paylocity continues to be recognized externally as we were recently named one of Forbes best large employers for America in 2024. I would now like to pass the call to Ryan to review the financial results in detail and provide updated fiscal 2024 guidance."}
{"doc_type": "earnings_call", "ticker": "PCTY", "period": "2024_Q3", "date": "2024-05-02", "section": "qa", "speaker": "Ryan Glenn", "text": "Thanks, Toby. Total revenue for Q3 was $401.3 million, an increase of 18.1% with recurring other revenues up 16.8% from the same period last year, and we were pleased to come in $2.3 million above the high-end of our Q3 revenue guidance. Our adjusted gross profit was 75.9% for Q3 as we continue to drive focus on scaling our operational costs on an annual basis while maintaining industry-leading service levels. We continue to make significant investments in research and development and to understand our overall investment in R&D, it is important to combine both what we expense and what we capitalize. On a dollar basis, our year-over-year investment in total R&D increased by 13.4% when compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2023 and we remain focused on making incremental investments in R&D as we continue to build out the Paylocity platform to serve the needs of the modern workforce. In regards to our go-to-market activities. On a non-GAAP basis, sales and marketing expenses were 19.2% of revenue in Q3, and we also remain focused on making incremental investments in this area of the business to drive growth going forward. On a non-GAAP basis, G&A costs were 8.5% of revenue in the third quarter versus 10.4% in the same period last year, representing 190 basis points of leverage in Q3. Our adjusted EBITDA was $167.9 million or 41.8% of revenue for the quarter, which exceeded our guidance by $12.9 million at the midpoint and represented 340 basis points of leverage versus Q3 of fiscal 2023. Briefly covering our GAAP results. For Q3, gross profit was $285.3 million. Operating income was $106.3 million and net income was $85.3 million. In regard to the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with cash, cash equivalents and invested corporate cash of $492.7 million and no debt outstanding. We continue to be pleased by our ability to drive increased profitability through leverage and adjusted gross margin, adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow while also maintaining strong revenue growth. Our increased adjusted EBITDA guidance for fiscal 2024 represents 35.2% margin, implying 330 basis points of margin expansion over fiscal 2023 or 190 basis points of margin expansion when excluding interest income and client-held funds. As we look forward and acknowledging the uncertain interest rate environment, we also remain confident in our ability to drive continued margin expansion when excluding interest income on client-held funds in fiscal 2025 and beyond. As a result of our strong profitability and cash flows, the confidence we have in our business and our focus on driving shareholder value, our Board of Directors has authorized a $500 million share repurchase program. In addition to managing dilution through our newly authorized $500 million share repurchase program, we are also increasingly focused on driving leverage and stock-based compensation expense on an annual basis with a target stock-based comp level of less than 10% of revenue, which we expect to achieve in the coming years. In regard to client-held funds and interest income, our average daily balance of client funds was $3 billion in Q3, and we are estimating the average daily balance will be approximately $2.8 billion in Q4 with an average annual yield of approximately 450 basis points to 455 basis points. Please note that our fiscal 2024 guidance does not include the impact of any future interest rate changes. In regard to client workforce levels, year-over-year employees in the platform growth was in line with our expectations in Q3. And given continued macro uncertainty, we are taking a measured approach to Q4 expectations. With that said, I'd like to provide our financial guidance for Q4 and full fiscal 2024. For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024, total revenue is expected to be in the range of $347.8 million to $351.8 million or approximately 13% growth over fourth quarter fiscal 2023 total revenue. And adjusted EBITDA is expected to be in the range of $104.1 million to $107.1 million. And for fiscal 2024, total revenue is expected to be in the range of $1.393 billion to $1.397 billion or approximately 19% growth over fiscal 2023. And adjusted EBITDA is expected to be in the range of $489.5 million to $492.5 million, implying an adjusted EBITDA margin of approximately 35.2% and representing leverage of 330 basis points versus last fiscal year. Based on the interest income assumptions provided earlier in my prepared remarks and our total revenue guidance, our implied recurring revenue growth for Q4 is approximately 13%. Our focus remains on driving strong revenue growth, increasing productivity and profitability levels on an annual basis and continuing to drive shareholder value. Against an uncertain macroeconomic environment and with guidance of nearly $1.4 billion of revenue this fiscal year, our focus is aligning all aspects of our organization towards achieving $2 billion of revenue as the next key milestone of our evolution as the most modern HCM provider in the industry. In addition to aligning our focus on achieving $2 billion of revenue, we are reconfirming our other current financial targets as followed. Our adjusted gross margin target of 75% to 80%, our total research and development target of 10% to 15% of revenue, our sales and marketing target of 20% to 25% of revenue, our general and administrative target of 5% to 10% of revenue, our adjusted EBITDA margin target of 35% to 40% of revenue, our free cash flow margin target of 20% to 25% and our newly added stock-based comp target of less than 10% of revenue. Operator, we are now ready for questions."}

I mean I think overall, I would say that expectations were met in terms of the demand environment in the quarter. I mean, I think overall, I mean, our value prop and strategy, I think, continues to resonate. I think we were overall pleased with what we saw from a channel contribution perspective, still maintaining north of 25% of new business. I think the top of funnel activity, I think, was in line with what we thought it would be. And I think overall, continuing to attract and retain strong talent from a go-to-market perspective. So I think, overall, probably in line with what we had seen last quarter and what we expected to see in this quarter."}

No, I think building on our comments from last quarter, we definitely think there's an opportunity for us to really drive on productivity. We talked about some of our new financial targets. We've had a really good year from an adjusted EBITDA expansion and making sure that we're really balancing a focus on growth is the number one priority, but really a close second is driving profitability targets. And we think as we go into the next year, we have an opportunity to not hire quite at that same rate. We'll give you the exact percentage as we go into the next earnings call, but to really focus on productivity improvements in the sales force, which we're happy with the initial that are in place."}

And I think we have made improvements in our ability to go back to the base. That has grown faster than we've grown kind of the new ARR revenue consistently for the last several years. And I think that opportunity is still ahead of us, and we'll continue to do that. I don't see that being an order of magnitude change. We've expanded that every year. That's worked pretty well for us. That team has done really well this year. They continue to do well, and we expect to be able to grow them above kind of our growth rate of our outside field organization, but I wouldn't call it any type of giant step function. It's about gradually adding product, making sure that product is adopted by our clients and then making sure that we've got a nice cadence and rhythm where we're pushing the products back to the clients who need it, but not necessarily going overboard with it because it becomes really scalable for us over time to be able to continually gradually increase it."}

I don't think there's any real update from an M&A strategy perspective. I think we've been fairly consistent with that over time. We've been focused on product-oriented or technology-oriented deals that we've done that have mostly been on the smaller side. I think in terms of the timing, I mean, we ended the quarter with almost $500 million in cash on balance sheet, and you can see the strong progress we made from a free cash flow perspective. And obviously, we also have a ton of revolver capacity. So I think we felt like this was a reasonable time to put a repurchase program in place. And I think when you look at the trading multiples and where those are right now sort of at or around multiyear lows, while the business continues to perform really well. I think it's a decent time to continue using that lever to drive shareholder value and doing the buyback. And I think you also get some offset from a stock composition perspective, which we're also obviously focused on with the inclusion of SBC as a target. So I think those are probably all the things that went into the mix."}

I wanted to maybe ask one and just getting clarity on the long-term outlook. I just wanted to understand on the 20% long-term growth target. Is that just for looking in the near-term? Or should we still think about 20% over a longer period? Is it still comparable? Is it against the $2 billion target previously? I just wanted to make sure we had clarity on that."}

I think if you look at where our growth rate is this past quarter and then what we're guiding to in fourth quarter, it is definitely below the 20%. And so we've been below that target for a little while. I think where we think the business is we are still growth as the number one priority. 20% is probably not the right target in terms of where we sit today. We'll focus on growth as that number one priority. And at the same time, we've introduced SBC and really focused on the profitability target. So you see a little bit more of a balance than maybe where we were three or four years ago. And so setting a $2 billion milestone for the company, certainly is where we're going to stop, but seems to be a better way to focus on growth versus that 20% target that probably isn't really the right fit for us in terms of what we've seen recently and how we think the business will evolve over time."}

As I think about where you guys are in size and scale, I'm curious if you've started to see in the pipeline or in deals that you're winning, where it's more replacements of potentially other cloud solutions?

I think that's a question that we've gotten before, and it's really just a function of our growth, plus the other cloud competitors growth. We still have a relatively low share of the market. Everybody does payroll in some way, shape or form, and they buy some subset of the HR module. So all of our sales are replacement for an existing method. Sometimes that software, sometimes that is the big players, the legacy players that have been around a long time. And then as we grow and the cloud players grow, we do start to run into each other a little more. The take rate to and from still isn't a very large percentage, it's still relatively low. We probably see each other more competitively in deals than anything else."}

I mean I think overall, when you look at the environment overall and you look at how we're positioned and how we performed so far throughout the course of the fiscal year, and then overall, the guide in Q4 and the guide for fiscal 2024. I mean I think overall, we're definitely pleased with the mix, as Steve was saying a minute ago, of growth and profitability that we've been able to deliver. I think we're really happy with the level of innovation that we've been able to deliver over the last 12 months, launching so many new products, and getting over that 550 mark in PEPY. And I think then overall, just again, focused on productivity and still driving growth, focused on productivity, focused on profitability and the authorization on the buyback. I mean I think there's a lot of good things that we've been able to deliver throughout the course of this fiscal year and that are coming with Q4. And I think to some degree, Q4 is probably the starting point for when you start to think about 2025."}

The only thing I would add to that is obviously, as I referenced in the prepared remarks, I think we continue to be fairly thoughtful on expectations and impact from the macro standpoint. So the third quarter came in consistent with what we expected. So we're still expecting some level of softness in Q4. We'll see if that's how things turn out. But I think that's one of the variables that we try to be pretty measured on given the uncertainty in the environment. More broadly speaking to Toby's point, as you think about 2025, obviously, we'll provide formal guidance on the August call. But we continue to see some level of elongation in sales cycles with larger clients. I think we're seeing progress there. We're certainly happy with some of the things we're doing from an up-market standpoint. But I think we'll take all that into consideration as well as update where the macro environment sits when we guide fiscal 2025 in August."}

So we've been really pleased with kind of our talent category in terms of the penetration rates that have increased every single year. Some of these new recruiting features that we touched on really will allow us to drive higher penetration and also be more competitive at the upper end of the market with our recruiting platform. So those have been really well received early on. And then if you think of what we're doing with things like community and driving collaboration and communication, that is available for all of our clients is not an extra fee for a lot of those capabilities. And so that really is a core part of our differentiated story about being the most modern platform in the industry. So I think you're going to see us continue to add additional modules that we can monetize. At the same time, we will look to add new interesting features based off our client feedback that really creates differentiation in the sales process and allows us to drive strong win rates, really in all size customers across our target market."}

Two things. First, Can you speak a little bit of what you hear in terms of AI, and I'm sorry to kind of ask this kind of very generic question. But like in the context of HR, is that kind of for you guys an opportunity in the short-term? Or is it in hindrance because people are focusing on something else at the moment and you guys kind of are suffering from that? And then the second question is on as you broaden out with the talent offering, et cetera. What does it mean for your go-to-market motion in terms of going back to your installed base, upselling, cross-selling potentially [indiscernible] you have more products driven. Thank you."}
{"doc_type": "earnings_call", "ticker": "PCTY", "period": "2024_Q3", "date": "2024-05-02", "section": "qa", "speaker": "Steve Beauchamp", "text": "Yes, I'll start with the first one. I think from an AI perspective, there's certainly lots of moving parts. It's a fast-changing market. We do think there's many opportunities from an HR perspective when you start really taking advantage of the capabilities that AI can drive. We have embedded AI capabilities across our product suite. Sometimes that appears to our customers in terms of personalization and recommendations, other times that appears in terms of writing assistance. Other times that appears in forecasting models. And we think there's plenty of opportunity for us to be able to continue to do that and innovate. And that really will help us reinforce our value prop of being the most modern platform in the industry. We also think HR platforms can be challenging sometimes for users to figure out all the different modules, they're buying more product from us. And so just from a serviceability of the product and being able to help our customers, we think that represents a big opportunity from an AI perspective that we're also investing in. And then the other part of your question is, do we think that maybe customers were not making decisions about HR platforms because they were investing in AI. I guess I don't know the answer to that. We certainly called out elongated sales cycles on the last earnings call. We've got initiatives really driven towards that. That's really more at the upper end of our market. We feel like we're making good progress there. We feel really good about our win rates overall in that market and the size of the pipeline. So I don't know what was necessarily causing that. I think the feedback we get from customers was more uncertainty in the economy than anything else, but it certainly could be a factor."}

And I think we – the team, as Steve was referencing a few minutes ago, I mean, I think the team has done a great job of being able to take both the products that have been in existence for a while, but also take the new products that we've developed and rolled out over the last handful of years and be able to add that value back to our existing customers and sell and cross-sell back into the base. So I think that's a multiyear effort that really started after the time of ACA. And I think we've continued the traction with that as we've launched and delivered the incremental products that we have, growing the PEPY from 200 at the time of the IPO to 550 where it sits today. So that's been a fairly – it's been a growing but fairly consistent motion over the course of the last handful of years."}

So we have been expanding upmarket over the last several years. We expanded that target market up to 5,000 employees a couple of years ago. And have really had great success over the last couple of years. If you look at the growth rate last fiscal year and the year before, we would have called up market as being one of the segments that was a real strong performer for us. This year as we entered it has gotten much bigger. We expanded pretty rapidly because we saw great receptivity. And from a customer perspective, we were really happy with our win rate, and we expanded that a fair amount. And I think what we saw and we called this out last quarter, is it took a little bit longer for some of the new reps to be able to ramp up than we expected. And we just saw elongation in the sales cycle really in the first couple of quarters of the year. As we sit here today, we feel really good about the initiatives that we've had to kind of improve that throughput, we're not all the way through that, but we certainly are in the middle of it. And I think you saw the performance in the quarter. I think we'd tell you we're having success across the board to be able to get to that level of performance. We feel good about where we sit right now. And we don't feel like the competitive environment is such that we can't be successful. Our win rates have been consistent over time, and we feel really good about the investments we've made in product and the feedback we're getting for customers in that segment."}

So nothing that I would call out that was necessarily a surprise on the fourth quarter, and I think you see that flow through from a guidance standpoint."}

{"doc_type": "earnings_call", "ticker": "PCTY", "period": "2024_Q3", "date": "2024-05-02", "section": "qa", "speaker": "Daniel Jester", "text": "Great. Thanks for taking my question. Maybe a couple for Ryan to start. Just on that last point about what's baked into the fourth quarter guide, if I remember correctly, you had a rate cut baked into that. And so I guess, one, correct me if I'm wrong, and two, how you are viewing that now in the fourth quarter guidance? And then on the third quarter gross margin, you've had basically two consecutive years of really strong expansion year-over-year there, but looks like gross margin was kind of flatish year-over-year, and so anything you call out for investment or how should we be thinking about gross margin going forward? Thanks."}
{"doc_type": "earnings_call", "ticker": "PCTY", "period": "2024_Q3", "date": "2024-05-02", "section": "qa", "speaker": "Ryan Glenn", "text": "Sure. So I guess relative to your first question, I did reference in my prepared remarks that we do not have a rate cut now assumed in the fourth quarter. You are correct that when we guide in February, we did call out a Q4 rate cut. We have taken that out based on latest forecast. And I think you've seen that flow through from an implied interest income in the fourth quarter. So we took up total revenue guide by about $8.5 million and I think, call it, $6 million or so of that was an interest income raise. So that is certainly, the performance we saw in Q3 within interest income as well as the removal of that rate cut, which helped the fourth quarter. I think relative to your question on gross margin, I think it can move around quarter-to-quarter. Year-to-date, I think we're up about 40 basis points on adjusted gross margin. Obviously, we've seen some headwind year-to-date relative to some of the workforce level headwinds that we've seen for the first nine months of the year. But I think if you look at back and sort of think about that holistically across a 12-month period, we'd expect to drive leverage year in and year out. Not always linear right? You're not going to get the same leverage each year. But as you step back and look at it on a longer-term basis, we continue to believe that there's the ability to scale adjusted gross margin. And I think that goes for the balance of the P&L. You saw some really significant leverage in G&A, not only in this quarter, but year-to-date, obviously, we raised adjusted EBITDA guidance by, call it, $15 million and almost 100 basis points. So continue to feel really good, as we said earlier in the call, not only about strong revenue growth and execution. But things like free cash flow being up 50%, large ranges in adjusted EBITDA and the ability to return value to shareholders through the buyback."}

And then if I can just sneak one more in. You've added a lot of new products the platform over the last year and some change. Maybe just an update in terms of customer uptake of the new iteration of products and maybe compare and contrast to some of the things that you've launched in the past is the velocity of attach rate similar or different? Or anything you'd call out there? Thank you."}
{"doc_type": "earnings_call", "ticker": "PCTY", "period": "2024_Q3", "date": "2024-05-02", "section": "qa", "speaker": "Steve Beauchamp", "text": "Yes. We've been really happy with the products that we've launched. Really, if you think about this past fiscal year, you've got Scheduling Plus, which is an advanced scheduling capability. That has certainly been received very well, probably skewed slightly average size customer being a little bit larger for those capabilities, but that's really helped us in that market, and we are continuing to develop new features for that Scheduling Plus skew. So we think that, that remains an opportunity going forward. Employee voice and rewards and recognition really great differentiators for us in the sales process. We always talk about trying to make sure when we build something, we can get to 10% to 20% market penetration within a reasonable time. I think – all of those products are kind of on track to hit those targets relative to what we've seen with other modules that we've built in the past. So we feel really good about the receptivity. And I think the other point I would make is really nice differentiators as well. So it's not just about actually driving the incremental PEPY but it's also about creating and adding value to the differentiated story that we're telling in the market."}

Would you say this focus is a trend that others are also pursuing? Or is this a differentiator that Paylocity is leading on?"}
{"doc_type": "earnings_call", "ticker": "PCTY", "period": "2024_Q3", "date": "2024-05-02", "section": "qa", "speaker": "Steve Beauchamp", "text": "That's a good question. Well, I think, obviously Gen Z is a growing part of the workforce, and that will continue to be the case. I think the other call out is Gen Z often has very different demands on HR departments. And those demands are things like they really want to be able to have a voice in decisions that are made. They want to understand how things are being – they want things to be communicated in a much more realtime basis. They really like a multimedia type approach to be able to understand what is really going on. And they really what to know what the organization culture is and their values, because the reality is still a very tight labor market, and they have options from a job perspective, and they don't have a problem looking from one to the other. And so organizations have to spend a significant amount of time not only on things like compliance and making sure payroll is right, making sure you're onboarded, but really trying to find connection, really developing career paths, making sure there's training opportunities. And so if you think about all of those challenges that all the HR teams have, many of the products that we have built over the last several years have really tried to provide unique capabilities for HR departments to be able to handle the dynamic nature of a multigenerational workforce that everybody is dealing with in a tight labor market. And so I think that message has resonated for the last several years, and I think it certainly does today. And we wanted to just call it the fact that many of our features including our mobile app and the ratings and the intuitive nature feedback – the intuitive nature of the product has really gotten us great feedback in terms of how customers are managing the growing Gen Z population."}

So Q3 came in consistent with expectations, which was some level of further moderation and then we did bake in beyond that, some additional moderation in Q4. And given I think that there is still some uncertainty out there from a macro standpoint, we did not update that assumption. We'll obviously see how that plays out, but that is the expectation going into Q4 from a guidance standpoint."}

Congrats on the best payroll print this season. I guess maybe just two quick ones for me. First, can we put a finer point on what gives you the confidence or conviction that these longer sales cycles at the higher end of the market are a kind of a macro versus micro or competition dynamic?"}
{"doc_type": "earnings_call", "ticker": "PCTY", "period": "2024_Q3", "date": "2024-05-02", "section": "qa", "speaker": "Steve Beauchamp", "text": "Yes, it's a good question. So what we really look at is we look at first the pipeline at the top end. And so first-time appointments, demo appointments that we're having with prospects, and then we track the duration of all of the various stages in the sales cycle. And so when things are challenging from a macro perspective, things stay in each of those stages for longer. So if it usually took us 35 days to go from one stage to the next, and all of a sudden it's taking us 55 days that's an indicator. And as long as you're not losing them off the bottom and your win rate is staying relatively similar, that's how we really kind of come to the conclusion that there's some macro uneasiness going on there. And so that's really what we've seen there's initiatives that you try to drive towards that, right? You get more teams involved with that. You really try to understand what an organization's concerns might be. You try to help move them along through the funnel. So it’s not like there's nothing we can do about that. And that's what we called out last quarter. Sometimes it's training reps to be able to have to manage those situations, making sure all the right people at the prospects are involved in the decision. And we've done a lot of that over the last quarter. And we feel like those initiatives are absolutely going to have an impact. And even if the market stays a little bit soft in terms of people making decisions. We feel like we've got the right solution. We're getting the right feedback. We like the win rates that we're driving. And we've got initiatives driving back to the team, so they're just going to be better at handling it."}

And then the second question is it's going to be a little bit long winded, but bear with me. If you look at the last kind of time you guys talked about that $2 billion target and that 20% growth rate. Yes, you kind of had you getting there roughly in fiscal 2026. And now if you think about the exit growth rate for Q4 and kind of playing that through the numbers that roughly has you getting there in about one year later. So is it fair to assume that like you're looking at the growth rate of your overall business as like a large growing x and the kind of core growing y. And that moderation in that large growth rate is what's driven that kind of one year out – or to push that target one year out or help us understand maybe if we kind of again break it apart into those two categories, how to think about it?"}
{"doc_type": "earnings_call", "ticker": "PCTY", "period": "2024_Q3", "date": "2024-05-02", "section": "qa", "speaker": "Steve Beauchamp", "text": "Yes. I think we would really look at the growth rate across our different segments have been fairly uniform on a go-forward basis. We did call out the fact that it was faster for several years, but it's really kind of getting in line with kind of our core segment as well as the larger upper end. I mean I think this is a little bit of a function of being a $1.4 billion business hitting scale, sometimes – even though there's a large market opportunity, it's a competitive market, and it can and it can be more challenging to be able to grow at that same rate when you were half the size. And so we're still prioritizing growth. We're still going to focus on doing everything we can to be able to grow as fast as we can. And at the same time, we think we can kind of balance all the profitability targets. And so I think it becomes a little bit more of a balanced story than just only growth. And we feel like that's the right thing to do to deliver the most shareholder value."}

So Ryan, if I look at your Q3 sequential growth rate for recurring and other revenue 23%. That was better than last year Q3 whereas Q1 and Q2 sequential growth are way below last year.

I did get this question in some of the after quarters last quarter relative to sequential revenue. And I think where we sat guiding and I think February 7 or so. We obviously had a really good idea of what started in January. We had a very solid number from a W-2 and form filings perspective. And I think we're able to take all that into account in the quarter. So certainly came in incrementally better than expectations. But on $366.8 million number, we're really about $300,000 or so above the top end of the range. So incrementally better, yes, but relative to that size, I think we were certainly pleased with the results, but nothing I'd call out is material and onetime nature."}

So form filing is going to be built based off of the number of employees that you have in the previous calendar year. And if you think about that, that's going to kind of grow with the number of employees on our platform. We're also selling them a lot more product. So if anything, on a year-over-year basis, form filing typically doesn't always grow as fast as the rest of our revenue. So it's not actually a tailwind from a growth rate perspective. If anything, it's a slight headwind. And there was nothing out of the ordinary this year."}

Thanks for taking the question. I guess as you look at the progress of some of the go-to-market corrections or strategies you put in place over the last several months and the improvement is clearly showing here. I guess sort of two parts. One, how much more do you feel like you have to go or just sort of get the reps and the time-based elements through the system there? And then maybe more importantly, how is this impacting your head count planning, especially on the sales front, not only through the end of this year, but as you're planning fiscal 2025 and maybe how that shaped up in light of the improvements over the last few months."}
{"doc_type": "earnings_call", "ticker": "PCTY", "period": "2024_Q3", "date": "2024-05-02", "section": "qa", "speaker": "Steve Beauchamp", "text": "I don't think it changes our approach. I think we called out last quarter, we would be focused on productivity opportunities, the balance of this year and as we go into next year. So that's been factored into our thought process around head count. We definitely think there's opportunities there. We like some of the signs that we're seeing in terms of early in those opportunities. I think the only call out I would say is if you think of our average sized customer you can sell that by the time they agree to go on its four to six-week implementation, all that revenue happens pretty quick. When you go up market and you're kind of above 1,000 employees, you definitely can have people committing, call it, four to five or even six months ahead of time starting. So you do – you have these initiatives. You start to see the value of those, you start to see that in terms of clients signing up, but the start dates obviously can be several months out. And so it does have a little bit of a longer time period between driving the initiatives, seeing the improvements and then actually being able to kind of recognize that revenue has started. And so if I'm sitting here today, I would tell you that our big Super Bowl every year is January. And so a lot of these large initiatives will have large clients start every month. But certainly, we are focused on driving improvements throughout the balance of this calendar year and getting ready so that we've got a great January of next fiscal year. And that is typically the cadence when you're upper end of the market."}

Our strong results continued in Q2 with recurring and other revenue growth of 17%, as our differentiated value proposition of providing the most modern software in the industry continues to resonate in the marketplace. Total revenue grew 16% over Q2 of last year. Our sustained multiyear investment in R&D has resulted in strong product differentiation and significant expansion of our product suite, which has helped drive durable revenue growth and expanded average revenue per client. The recent launch of benefit decision support and our expansion into the office of the CFO with our integrated headcount planning product has increased our max PEPY from $550 to $600, achieving the target we set in August 2023. And this does not yet include any AI-based products. We also remain confident in our ability to drive further product expansion and further expansion of our average revenue per client across new and existing clients with new HCM and office of the CFO products over time. Additionally, our new AI assistant chatbot is now generally available to all Paylocity client admins, and we are pleased with early levels of adoption. Since launching in October, we have seen a 30% increase in utilization, and key features such as natural language search capabilities, which are available in our reporting product, have driven an over 20% reduction in time required for our users to find reports. We are encouraged by the benefits our AI-related investments are driving for our clients and excited to continue adding additional AI-enabled functionality and key use cases over time. Our ongoing commitment to product innovation continues to be recognized by third parties, as Paylocity was recently awarded the TrustRadius Buyer's Choice Award and named overall leader in ten HCM product categories in G2's Winter 2025 Grid Reports. I would now like to pass the call to Toby to provide further color on the quarter."}

As Steve highlighted, the momentum seen in Q1 continued into the second quarter, resulting in solid selling season performance and increased revenue and profitability guidance for fiscal 2025. Our results are driven by strong sales and operational execution, continued product differentiation, and a more stable macroeconomic environment. We also continue to be pleased by our ability to add talented sales reps and solution consultants, and our ongoing investments in training and development across our sales team helped contribute to another quarter of strong go-to-market execution, including continued traction upmarket. Additionally, we are pleased to see another quarter of strong performance across the broker referral network, which once again delivered more than 25% of our new business in Q2. The sustained success of our broker channel is driven by our modern platform, marketplace ecosystem, third-party integration and API capabilities, and because we do not compete against our broker partners by selling insurance products. We remain committed to investing in and supporting the broker channel going forward, with the goal of continuing to deliver real value and true partnership and support to our referring brokers and clients. Overall, we are pleased with Q2 results and believe we are well-positioned heading into the back half of the fiscal year, which is reflected in our increased guidance for fiscal 2025. While still in the very early days, we're pleased with the reception of the Airbase acquisition from both existing and prospective clients, and we will continue driving the integration process across our teams and our platform. From our early conversations, the value proposition of having a single platform through which all payroll and non-payroll related spend can be managed with a robust set of integrations with key third-party systems is resonating with decision-makers across our target market. We are also pleased with the ability to collaborate with mutual clients to drive a combined roadmap that delivers incremental value to businesses across our target market. Finally, this time of year is a very busy time for all of our teams as they work closely with clients on year-end processing of payrolls, W-2s, 1095, and annual tax form filings to federal, state, and local agencies and on the implementation of new clients. I want to thank all of our employees for their hard work and dedication to our clients during this very busy time of year. The strong culture at Paylocity also continues to be recognized externally as we recently were named to Forbes list of America's Most Trusted Companies and Fortune's list in 2024 Best Workplaces in Technology in addition to being recognized as one of America's Greatest Places for Workplaces for Diversity by Newsweek for the second consecutive year. I would now like to pass the call to Ryan to review the financial results in detail and provide our increased fiscal 2025 guidance."}
{"doc_type": "earnings_call", "ticker": "PCTY", "period": "2025_Q2", "date": "2025-02-06", "section": "qa", "speaker": "Ryan Glenn", "text": "Thanks, Toby. Q2 recurring and other revenue was $347.7 million, an increase of 17%, with total revenue of $377 million, up 16% from the same period last year. Our strong Q2 results were primarily driven by another solid quarter for our sales team, allowing us to come in $8 million above the top end of our revenue guidance, and resulting in a raise for our fiscal year guidance by more than our beat for the second consecutive quarter. Our adjusted gross profit was 73.8% for Q2, versus 72.7% in Q2 of last fiscal, representing a 110 basis points of leverage as we continue to focus on scaling our operational costs while maintaining industry-leading service levels. We continue to invest in research and development and understand our overall investment in R&D. It is important to combine both what we expense and what we capitalize. On a dollar basis, our year-over-year investment in total R&D increased by 16.2% compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2024, and we remain focused on making investments in R&D throughout fiscal 2025 as we continue to build out the Paylocity platform to serve the needs of the modern workforce. In regards to our go-to-market activities, on a non-GAAP basis, sales and marketing expenses were 21.7% of revenue in the second quarter. And on a non-GAAP basis, G&A was 9.8% of revenue in the second quarter, and we remain focused on consistently leveraging our G&A expenses on an annual basis. Our adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter was $126.2 million, or a 33.5% margin, exceeding the midpoint of our guidance by $8.2 million. Excluding the impact of interest income on funds held for clients, adjusted EBITDA was $96.9 million, also exceeding our guidance for Q2. Briefly covering our GAAP results for Q2, gross profit was $252.4 million, operating income was $46.6 million, and net income was $37.5 million. In regard to the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $482.4 million and $325 million in debt outstanding related to the funding of the Airbase acquisition. In regard to client-held funds and interest income, our average daily balance of client funds was approximately $2.8 billion in Q2. We're estimating the average daily balance will be approximately $3.2 billion in Q3, with an average annual yield of approximately 360 basis points, representing approximately $29 million of interest income in Q3. On a full-year basis, we are estimating the average daily balance will be $2.9 billion with an average annual yield of approximately 390 basis points, representing approximately $113 million of interest income. In regard to interest rates, our guidance reflects all Fed cuts to date with an additional 25 basis point rate cut assumed in May. Additionally, given the confidence we have in our business and our strong cash flows, we continue to utilize our share repurchase program with $8.6 million or approximately 40,000 shares of common stock repurchased in Q2 at an average price of $197.90 per share. As a reminder, we have approximately $341 million remaining under our share repurchase program and anticipate continuing to execute against the program over the remainder of the year. Finally, I'd like to provide our financial guidance for Q3 and full fiscal 2025. Note that as a result of strong selling season and continued momentum across our sales team, our fiscal 2025 recurring and other revenue guidance increased by $15.5 million and our total revenue guidance by $20.5 million at the midpoint, which includes the full impact of our guidance beat in Q2, and a further increase in back half fiscal 2025 revenue guidance. Additionally, we continue to realize success driving increased profitability across our business, resulting in increased adjusted EBITDA guidance, which includes the full impact of our guidance beat in Q2 and increased profitability expectations for fiscal 2025. With that said, for the third quarter of fiscal 2025, recurring and other revenue is expected to be in the range of $410 million to $415 million, or approximately 12% to 13% growth over third quarter fiscal 2024 recurring revenue. And total revenue is expected to be in the range of $439 million to $444 million, or approximately 10% growth over third quarter fiscal 2024 total revenue. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be in the range of $171 million to $175 million. Adjusted EBITDA excluding interest income on funds held for clients is expected to be in the range of $142 million to $146 million. And for fiscal year 2025, we are increasing all aspects of our guidance as follows. Recurring and other revenue guidance is now expected to be in the range of $1.445 billion to $1.455 billion, or approximately 13% growth over fiscal 2024 recurring and other revenue. Total revenue guidance is expected to be in the range of $1.558 billion to $1.568 billion, or approximately 11% growth over fiscal 2024. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be in the range of $542 million to $550 million. And adjusted EBITDA excluding interest income on funds held for clients is expected to be in the range of $429 million to $437 million. In conclusion, we are pleased with our Q2 results and the momentum we have across our sales and operations team as we exit our busiest time of the year. Operator, we are now ready for questions. Thank you."}

I mean, think if you look at what's made us successful over time, with the broker channel, it's been the investments that we've made to build those relationships to provide, you know, a meaningful technology to them, visibility into their business. It's being able to provide integrations that matter and ultimately, I mean, we don't compete with the broker channel with the sale of insurance products. And so I think those are the things that have made us successful and helped us build meaningful relationships with that channel. And I think that's, you know, that's what we wanna be able to do as we look forward. And, you know, I think if there's any disruption that comes from a deal like that, that's where we want to be to provide those types of relationships with brokers that are successful."}

{"doc_type": "earnings_call", "ticker": "PCTY", "period": "2025_Q2", "date": "2025-02-06", "section": "qa", "speaker": "Toby Williams", "text": "Well, I think a lot of the relationships that we have have been built over time with our sales force in the field. And I think when those relationships exist, they tend to be productive. You know, it doesn't take years to get them to be productive. It's all about our ability to build those relationships, make the connection, and then being able to communicate the value that I just ran through. And when we can do that, we can usually make those productive in the near term. I think I was mentioning, Brad, just to add to that is, yeah, no problem, is oftentimes the broker relationships are not necessarily exclusive, meaning, you know, they might refer to Paylocity, they might refer multiple providers. We obviously wanna be that premier provider in each of these relationships. And so if there happens to be less competition in the market and fewer options available, then I think to Toby's point, we feel like we are really well-positioned since we've been doing that really from the very start of Paylocity. With a great reputation in the market to take advantage of that."}

How do you think about sales hiring this year during calendar 2025 as you start to think about 2026?

I know this is typically when you start to hire more at least into the spring for the busy selling season. Thanks."}

And the focus was really on, you know, driving productivity across our go-to-market teams. And that if we, you know, saw a market change in the macro, I mean, we still would have room to be able to continue to invest throughout the course of the year if leaning in made sense. And I think as we sit here, you know, coming through, you know, the first half, I think we performed well in selling season. We feel good about the momentum that our go-to-market teams have had, and I feel like it's been a more stable environment than we would have seen last year. And so, you know, I think we feel good about the investments that we made coming into the year and still, you know, remain optimistic about our ability to be a destination for talent, particularly in go-to-market, in the industry, and, you know, I think when those opportunities present themselves, we're ready."}

Thanks for taking my questions and good to see the strong quarter. Just one note for my good friend, Scott. Dumbledore said it could be happening inside your head. But doesn't mean it shouldn't be real on earth either. So just remember that, Scott. So Toby and Steve, for you guys, I want to ask about Airbase. And I know you're talking about the early impression that you're getting from customers that it's been well received. I guess, can you maybe just help us understand what for the customers that you've sold it to since the acquisition, have you seen them buy it upfront along with the rest of the suite, or are you seeing them engage in conversation? And put it as something down the road. Maybe just help us understand what that level of receptivity has been and how that's manifested in the numbers."}
{"doc_type": "earnings_call", "ticker": "PCTY", "period": "2025_Q2", "date": "2025-02-06", "section": "qa", "speaker": "Steve Beauchamp", "text": "Sure. So, obviously, you know, all under, you know, Airbase is still a relatively small revenue stream when you look at our overall business. But having said that, we are pleased with the early indications in both scenarios. First, interactions with our sales team that are bringing clients on board upfront. We're seeing some activity there where customers are interested in having that conversation about how Airbase products can help them as they look at modernizing their HCM suite. So some good examples there. And then at the same time, as we go back to our existing customers and we talk to them about this acquisition and how we might be able to help them, we're also seeing some interest. That's all being done as we're working on the product integration, which we think will only increase the value proposition over time. So I think we're happy early on with both the team that we brought over with Airbase and the early reception from both our customers and prospects in the market."}

Can you give us an idea of what the contribution from Airbase was in the quarter? And just as I think about the upward revision to the guidance, that's because that's a really positive outcome. And how much of an influence did Airbase have on that, or was that all for the core business?"}
{"doc_type": "earnings_call", "ticker": "PCTY", "period": "2025_Q2", "date": "2025-02-06", "section": "qa", "speaker": "Ryan Glenn", "text": "Yeah. I would think of the contribution from Airbase being consistent with how we sized it last quarter, which is roughly 1% of revenue or so this fiscal year. So to Steve's point, I think that business is performing as expected and relative to the overall business is fairly small. So when you think about both the results in Q2 and the larger guidance raised in the back half of the year, I would view that as really driven by core Paylocity overperformance."}

Thanks for taking my questions, and let me add my congratulations. Great quarter. Wondering if you can talk a little bit about what you're seeing just in terms of the differences between the mid-market relative to the upper end of your target market. In the past, you had talked about longer decision cycles in the upper end. Are you seeing any change in tone? And what are you seeing in terms of receptivity or areas of strength and any areas that are more or less competitive?"}

I think if you go back to this time last year, you know, we were talking about the fact that we had seen longer sales cycles, particularly in the upper end of the market. And part of that was due to more, I think, cycles through with decision-makers and seeing more demos, etcetera, things like that. And, yeah, I think as we came through the third quarter and then through the fourth quarter of last year, we also started to see a little bit more stability in the market. I think as we came into this year, you know, that's really how we set the year up. I think that's what we saw through Q1, and I would say, you know, stable through Q2. I don't think we saw any significant change in the dynamics in the market, but we did feel like it was more stable. And I think, you know, coming through selling season, you know, really proud of how our teams executed. And I think they carried some momentum from, you know, from Q1 into Q2, and, you know, I think it was a strong execution quarter for the teams in selling season."}

And then it sounds like, you know, both the benefits decision support and headcount planning are off to a good start. Can you give us a little bit more of a feel in terms of the level of receptivity, how much are you getting in terms of new sales, who's that appealing to? Particularly in terms of headcount planning, which goes into the office of the CFO. Anything there would be helpful."}
{"doc_type": "earnings_call", "ticker": "PCTY", "period": "2025_Q2", "date": "2025-02-06", "section": "qa", "speaker": "Steve Beauchamp", "text": "Yeah. So I think we're definitely happy with the start for headcount planning. As you mentioned, it is the first product in that office of the CFO category and being able to deliver that to oftentimes both new customers, many of those who are starting in January and probably haven't fully taken advantage of headcount planning yet, but also back to the base and getting some of our existing customers. That's probably where we've gotten even more feedback from existing customers as they're going through an annual cycle, going through their planning cycle, you know, they were able to use that tool to do, you know, better headcount planning than they would have oftentimes been doing in spreadsheets and manually. So off to a good start. As you know, Mark, we always try to target these new products to get them into the 10% to 20% penetration range over time, get them off to a good start. And I would say that that's certainly the case with both these products. I think the benefit decision support has a little bit of cyclical nature to it. You know, benefit enrollment happens throughout the year, but it is a little bit more concentrated in the fall. We were able to get some great feedback from customers that used that tool in the fall. And, you know, we think we've got momentum as new customers are coming on and they plan on using our benefit enrollment tool both throughout the year, but again this fall that it's going to deliver a much better experience for employees and also has some real nice value to brokers."}

I have a quick question. So you're saying that your PEPY has reached your target of $600 and you've reached this goal. What is a high-level thought on how you're now recalibrating, rethink about a new target going forward?"}
{"doc_type": "earnings_call", "ticker": "PCTY", "period": "2025_Q2", "date": "2025-02-06", "section": "qa", "speaker": "Steve Beauchamp", "text": "Sure. I'll take that. So, yeah, we're really proud of being able to reach that goal back in 2014 at IPO. We tripled the amount of product that we've been able to sell. And so we also see a big opportunity for us to be able to do that. The PEPM model is certainly one that works very well when you think of HCM products as we move into the office of the CFO, some of those might not be that same pricing model. However, I don't think that changes the mix of new units and ARPU over time. So you'll see us continue to focus on that average revenue per customer growth, which might be priced a little bit differently depending on the product category. But it's the same model that we've really kind of operated. And so we'll have to give some thought in terms of how we discuss that on a go-forward basis. But as I mentioned earlier, we're still very early innings into the Airbase acquisition. And so I would expect more color over time, but no change in focus. Continue to drive more new products back to the existing customers and new customers continue to drive both units as well as ARPU as the formula for growth."}

And then also speaking about Airbase a little bit, I know it's early days still on this integration, but a little bit curious. I hear things keep on next twelve to eighteen months of this integration pass, how are you balancing the prioritization of integrating Airbase versus continuing driving these new product launches and continuing driving the penetration with existing products."}

I would say at our current scale, you know, roughly one and a half billion dollars in revenue, we've consistently continued to invest a similar percentage back into R&D that has been part of our belief that the product differentiation is what's really driving the performance over time. And so we will balance the investment both in terms of enhancements and features to our customers with existing products, new HCM products, innovation capabilities with things like AI, and then at the same time make investments into new categories. I think we've had a pretty good history of being able to do that and been first to market in many of those categories. And so we feel like we're well-positioned to be able to do that. Oftentimes and most of the time, that's organic. In some cases, we've made some strategic acquisitions where we think it's a great fit. We spend the time to integrate that product so the customer experience mirrors something that we would build. And we've got to continue to balance our portfolio of investments from an R&D perspective. But certainly, increased size and scale allows us to do that."}

Thank you for taking my question. Ryan, great outcome on the EBITDA line. If I look at the free cash flow of the business, doesn't look as expansive on a year-over-year basis. My guess is that Airbase is kinda muddying the waters a little bit there. So can you help us think about the conversion of EBITDA to free cash flow for the rest of the year? Any puts and takes we should be considering, we're working through our model."}

Obviously, we don't guide to free cash flow specifically and certainly quarter to quarter that number moves around with timing of spend. So nothing that I would call out that would be concerning or one-time to your point. There's obviously a headwind this fiscal year relative to the Airbase acquisition, which we've characterized as roughly a hundred basis point headwind for adjusted EBITDA. I think the headwind to free cash flow is pretty similar. So when you think where we are today, on a TTM basis, free cash flow roughly 21% margin, we do have the headwind over the balance of this fiscal year. I think we will end up somewhere north of 20% this year. That's not formal guidance, but I think when you look at where this goes going forward into 2026 and beyond, expect to be able to continue to drive leverage going forward. But wouldn't have any specific current concerns relative to Q2, just some timing of when some of the cash flows hit within the year."}

And then, you said in the past, Airbase is certainly gonna be something that you're gonna try to push back into your current customer base.

I mean, yeah, we have called this out over time, and we have invested in both. So I think going back to 2015, 2016 time frame, started to invest in a team to sell back in the customer base and that's grown over the course of time since then. I think the mix has continually shifted in terms of, you know, higher percentage of growth in that team that's selling back into the base relative to the field. But it's, I think to Steve's comments a few minutes ago, the focus has absolutely been from a go-to-market spend standpoint to focus on new units. That's a really important part of the growth algorithm while also focusing on our ability to and investing in our ability to go back to the client base as our product set has expanded now to $600 in PEPY.

So certainly have no inside information but I think just from a macro perspective, there has been consolidation in this industry over time. It is, you know, businesses that can drive pretty high margin. So as you're able to do that, you can typically take some cost savings out. I think they called some of that out in their press release in terms of targeting some cost savings. I think Paycor has focused a little bit of a larger size customer than Paychex historically. So I think you put all that together and that's, at least, is the rationale that I would think about. And I think from our perspective, we're gonna continue to do what we were doing before. You know, it's really about innovating. We've fared very well against both those competitors. They're strong competitors, for sure. But they're someone that we've had success with over time. And so we feel like if there's a change in their strategy, if there's any type of disruption, then that could be incrementally beneficial to us. Otherwise, we're gonna continue to do what we do and deliver the most modern experience to our customer."}

Going back to Airbase again, so is your plan now to run this as an independent group or even keep that product in the same form, or are you planning to, you know, rebuild on the Paylocity platform before you go to your Paylocity customer base to cross-sell this? Basically, my question, when should we start thinking about cross-sell opportunity of, you know, Airbase into Paylocity?"}

So I think stepping back from a long-term perspective, our goal will be to integrate those platforms over time so that we're delivering a very unified and holistic experience as well as all the spend management capabilities. That will certainly take some time. Having said that, our customers can still benefit from some of the integration that already exists and that we're gonna be adding over time. And so we will continue to sell new customers. We will sell back to our customer base in such a way that we'll grow over time. And so as we go into next fiscal, I would say, you know, throughout next fiscal and throughout the back half of next fiscal, I would imagine we start to gain some momentum with product integration. It'll be a multiyear effort. But the bigger opportunity from our perspective is really this that you will continue to grow standalone revenue within Airbase. But the bigger opportunity is the cross-sell. And to your point, that in you look at our history, that will take us twelve to eighteen months, this a little bit larger acquisition. Wouldn't surprise me if that's more in the twelve to twenty-four months. But what I'm really happy about is even without all the benefit that we're gonna be able to deliver from a truly integrated platform, we're still seeing good receptivity from both prospects as well as existing customers. So off to a really good start."}

And then, Ryan, a follow-up to your guidance. You know, you had a pretty strong first half, and if I look at your Q3 guidance, it implies that your Q4 recurring revenue will be probably 10% or below. Is there anything that we should think about or is it conservatory some year?"}
{"doc_type": "earnings_call", "ticker": "PCTY", "period": "2025_Q2", "date": "2025-02-06", "section": "qa", "speaker": "Ryan Glenn", "text": "Yeah. See, that I probably characterize it, I think, a few different ways. If you step back and think about how we set up the initial guide for this fiscal year, I think we were really clear that we felt like we wanted to return to a beat and raise cadence and I think we viewed it as if we had strong execution across the sales team and from an operational standpoint, we'd be in a spot to be able to beat and raise. And we're halfway through the year. We've raised both quarters. We've raised both quarters by more than the beat. And I think within our guidance philosophy, our view is we have raised pretty significantly, if we continue to see strong sales performance, then you've heard from us here today relative to the momentum we feel like we have in that team that come May earnings call, we'd be in a spot to potentially raise again. I think probably the one thing I would call out relative to Q2 versus Q3 is while the vast majority of the overperformance we saw in Q2 was sales-driven, we did see pull forward of call it, a handful of million dollars of recurring revenue that we would have typically expected to see in Q3. And that's really driven off of some client starts that came in a little bit earlier. So both new and some of the upsells we have to existing clients, being able to get those in a couple of months earlier. Net positive, I think, both from our perspective as well as clients that, you know, get the product in the hands of the clients earlier, the implementation process is smooth, and for us, it's all recurring revenue. So we did see that slight pull forward between Q2 and Q3. But, you know, when you think about the guide both third quarter and to the fourth quarter, again, we feel like if we perform well, we should be able to beat and raise over the balance of the year."}

I think broadly speaking, we've seen a really stable macro, and I think that that's, you know, from a macro standpoint across the board within employees in the platform. You know, as you know, we probably had a, you know, a touch of conservatism or prudence into the guidance. We did not assume any increase, and, you know, I'd say there's probably modest upside to that in the first half of the fiscal year. Not particularly material, but net net and overall positive. I think relatively the guide in the back half of the year, we continue to take a prudent approach. So to the extent you see a little bit of upside there, that would potentially provide some modest upside to revenue in the back of the year. But overall, it's been pretty stable. Nothing I'd call out as particularly, you know, materially different versus expectations."}

I mean, we've been pleased with the expanded gross margins we had really last year, but certainly the first half of this fiscal year as well. So I think Q1 was a strong quarter. And I think for us, continued to balance investments across our operational team to make sure we are driving that industry-leading service levels. But at the same time, we're working hard to make sure we're prioritizing spend, making sure that we're driving efficiencies and automation. I think we've been able to balance that. We feel really good about where we are from a retention and implementation standpoint, but at the same time, we're able to take advantage of our size, our scale, and the fact that we're investing across people, process, and technology to be able to drive some pretty healthy margin leverage while not having to sacrifice on the service side."}

As we mentioned in the prepared remarks, we were pretty happy with the launch of our internal chatbot that our customers are using. So probably gives the ability to really create a better experience overall. And so we're seeing some pretty nice increases. We still want them there for them when they call us and email us or interact with them, but it gives them really quick answers and maybe built-in advice over time. And so that's been really strong. We've got a number of other use cases that use generative capability. Things like writing announcements to all of your employees or job descriptions, we've got some things in rewards and recognition and performance. And so our approach overall is really to embed the AI capabilities to really make everyday processes even better for our customers. So sometimes that means faster, sometimes that means higher quality, sometimes it means it's just much easier for them to be able to get their jobs done. And we have a number of modules that we think we continue to enhance to do that. We think that's the bigger opportunity, both great service experience and differentiation embedded into the product. From a longer-term perspective, we'll certainly keep an eye out for monetization opportunities. But from a near term, it's really client satisfaction, efficiency, and differentiation."}

Congrats for me on the quarter. I'm running out of questions to ask. I mean, they're relegated to SuperVO picks or maybe an upmarket traction question. So I'll go for the latter so it doesn't get into a sensitive topic on picks. As it relates to the upmarket traction, I think that was in the prepared remarks. Maybe you could just share a little bit more about are you seeing any evolution on attach rate of other products beyond core and payroll? And what are you getting in terms of some early signals on their propensity to buy these office of CFO products maybe versus more of smaller mid-market or smaller customers. Thank you."}
{"doc_type": "earnings_call", "ticker": "PCTY", "period": "2025_Q2", "date": "2025-02-06", "section": "qa", "speaker": "Steve Beauchamp", "text": "Yeah. So I think the first part of the question, we are definitely seeing continued increases in attach rates. I would describe them as gradual increases in attach rates as we bring on some of the customers in the upper end of our market. And I would probably credit much of that to better execution on our part. We called that out a year ago, felt like there were a number of things that we could do, you know, training, staffing, different roles that support the sales organization. I think we've executed well on all those things, and we saw the benefit of that through selling season. I think you saw that with the guidance raise. I think that's probably the bigger element. We've seen product continue to perform well upmarket and continue to gradually increase attach rates. I think the second part of your question, one of the things we really liked about Airbase was the customer overlap. So the average size customer that they had was very much similar to our average-sized customer. So more than a hundred employees, but their average-sized customer wasn't, you know, ten thousand employees or in the enterprise space. So we think it's a nice product market fit. And therefore, you see us having the strategy of taking that product, getting feedback from customers, using that voice of the customer to continually enhance capabilities. And as we enhance the capabilities, just like we have in HCM, you'll start to continue to expand that target market, and it'll appeal to maybe slightly larger clients over time. And so I think you'll see the best receptivity early on in the core part of our market where we have the bulk of our customers and the bulk of our revenue. So that's certainly the strategy, and it'll certainly take us time to be able to execute upmarket, but we do think that that opportunity exists."}

I mean, I guess I would say that I wouldn't call out any significant movement in any of those things. I would more characterize it as as we came into this fiscal year, you know, after, you know, some after the overhang that we all saw across enterprise software and in our industry from a macro perspective, our of last fiscal year, we started to see that stabilize in Q4. And I think that's, you know, that's how we talked to you all about the setup coming into the fiscal year for Q1, and I think that's what we saw materialize in Q1 as well. It was just a level of stability in the demand environment that we hadn't seen during most of the prior year, and I think that really continued into Q2, and I think that put our go-to-market and sales teams in a really good position to, you know, talk to prospects about our value prop, and I'm, you know, talked earlier about the momentum that we saw in that and just, you know, really proud of their execution in the quarter."}

And then I guess just on, you know, maybe some of the Q2 versus Q3 dynamics, appreciate calling out some of those earlier starts here hitting in Q2. But anything else that we should kinda keep in mind for seasonality or maybe, you know, going through filing season, how should we be thinking about some of the impacts from that perspective between the quarters?"}

I think that has largely tracked consistent with expectations. Maybe the one thing I'd call out relative to form filings is that typically grows a touch less than recurring revenue. It grows more consistent with client growth or employee and the platform growth. So I think it's coming in consistent with expectations. Obviously, we're able to raise the fiscal year pretty significantly. But that's probably one when you look at the core recurring revenue versus form filings that would be, you know, a touch of a headwind into the third quarter. And then I think the other thing I'd mention would just be the contribution from Airbase doesn't have the same seasonal impact as our business. So from a growth standpoint, within year over year, you would see Airbase year over year have a little bit of a less impact to growth in Q3 versus Q2 or Q4 because you don't have that same seasonal bump that the core Paylocity business does. Outside of that, there's really nothing I'd call out as material."}

So that ends up putting less of the burden on that front-end seller and allows us to have more specialized knowledge and more of an inside team type of model. So that is likely the motion that we certainly start with.

But now that we're shifting more into kind of the agentic AI season, is that something you're looking to also add to your platform?

So the interesting thing about our client's business and what they use us for is there are a lot of workflows. There's a lot of approvals. If you think of things start with an employee, they go to a manager, they have to be routed across the organization based on certain rules, they get approved. And so there are opportunities to be able to provide AI use cases that are really automating these experiences and or really maybe shortening the experience by leveraging the historical data that we have to be able to provide insights, skip some of the steps, do some of the work on behalf of our customers. I think we're in the early innings of that. And so yeah, we definitely feel like that is an opportunity over time. Whether that gets translated into pure monetization, better, more modern software that allows us some pricing power, or just differentiation, we think it's the right area of investment."}

You know, you've certainly been talking about Gen AI and some of the investments you've made and some of the benefits over the last few quarters. You know, the big question I have is, you know, hasn't started to kinda show up in terms of, like, improved win rates or in terms of kind of, like, ability to charge folks more or better margins? Like, where is sort of the Gen AI basically showing up in terms of your financials? And then the second thing is, you know, with some of these announcements made from kind of DeepMind kind of last week, does it change anything? Or does it matter to you at all?"}

So I don't think it changes anything in terms of how bullish we are on being able to create unique experiences leveraging whether it's machine learning algorithms, whether it's generative AI models or other types of agentic use cases, I think those are all opportunities for us. And I think the easy answer is, oh, all of a sudden we have something that we're gonna monetize and we can clearly talk about it. But I don't think that's really the way it's going to necessarily work. That may happen over time, but I think the bigger opportunity is us to leverage AI to continue to drive a better client experience, to increase margins over time, to be able to create more differentiation so that we can continue to grow recurring revenue and add units. Those all so I think AI has to be embedded throughout the organization and be in all parts of the business. Driving productivity, driving efficiency, driving client experience. And if we do that, that really helps us really deliver the vision of being the most modern platform in the industry is by embedding AI across the organization, and that's the approach that we're taking versus maybe being focused on some AI module that we would try to singularly monetize."}

And, you know, I'm just trying to figure out, you know, is it because of some of the legacy players getting more competitive?

{"doc_type": "earnings_call", "ticker": "PCTY", "period": "2025_Q3", "date": "2025-05-02", "section": "qa", "speaker": "Steve Beauchamp", "text": "Thanks, Ryan and thanks to all of you for joining us on our third quarter fiscal 2025 earnings call. Q3 represented another quarter of strong results with recurring and other revenue growth of 15%, driven by our differentiated value proposition of providing the most modern software in the industry continuing to resonate in the market. Total revenue grew 13% over Q3 of last year. Our sustained multiyear investment in R&D has resulted in continued product differentiation and a significant expansion of our product suite, which has helped drive durable recurring revenue growth and continued expansion of our average revenue per client. In addition to our entrance into the Office of the CFO with the acquisition of Airbase and the introduction of headcount planning, we have continued to build on our HCM industry leadership position on AI with a focus on driving a better client and user experience. For example, our AI assistant can now leverage a client's employee handbook to answer policy-related questions such as, what is my organization's PTO policy? Additionally, our AI assistant is able to reference publicly available resources to answer common compliance-related questions like, what sick pay laws apply to my organization? These automated instantaneous solutions are examples of the early AI use cases that we believe will drive tangible efficiency gains for our clients. We also recently launched several new features to connect and streamline the employee recruiting and onboarding process. Clients can now embed background checks and skill assessments from third-party vendors into our recruiting module through seamless API integrations. We believe continued investment in our broad ecosystem of third-party partners will provide our clients with the tools needed to run and grow their business. Combined with our ongoing investments in both HCM and finance, we are confident we will continue to drive higher average revenue per client over time, which is now how we think about the economic opportunity associated with our product growth given that not all of our new products will be priced in a PEPY model. But all of our products will contribute to a higher average revenue per client over time. Our commitment to product development also continues to be recognized in the market with Paylocity recently being named to TrustRadius' list of best loved software for 2025 and an overall leader in 10 HCM product categories in G2's Spring 2025 Grid Reports. Additionally, Airbase by Paylocity was named a Visionary in the 2025 Gartner Magic Quadrant for Accounts Payable Applications. I would now like to pass the call to Toby to provide further color on the quarter."}
{"doc_type": "earnings_call", "ticker": "PCTY", "period": "2025_Q3", "date": "2025-05-02", "section": "qa", "speaker": "Toby Williams", "text": "Thanks Steve. Solid sales and operational execution continued in our busiest time of the year, helping to drive another quarter of strong recurring revenue growth and increased revenue and profitability guidance for fiscal 2025. Recurring and other revenue of $421.1 million grew 15% over Q3 of last year and beat the high end of our guidance by $6.1 million. We remain pleased with our sales execution and our strong competitive position in the market, and we continue to see our product strategy resonating with clients and prospects. We also saw another strong quarter of channel performance as channel referrals, primarily from benefit brokers and financial advisers, once again represented more than 25% of new business for the third quarter as we continue to leverage the strong source of referrals. The sustained success of our broker channel continues to be driven by our modern platform, third-party integration and API capabilities and because we do not compete against our broker partners by selling insurance products. We remain committed to investing in and supporting the broker channel going forward with the goal of continuing to deliver real value and true partnership and support to our referring brokers and clients. While still in the early days, the Airbase team is now fully integrated within Paylocity, and we're pleased with the progress we've made towards integrating the platforms from both a product and go-to-market perspective. The value proposition of having a single pane of glass through which all payroll and non-payroll-related spend can be managed with a robust set of integrations with third-party systems is resonating with existing and prospective clients. We expect this area will serve as a meaningful point of competitive differentiation, continue to build off the workforce planning capabilities offered as a part of our headcount planning solution and help to expand our average revenue per client going forward. Lastly, Q3 represents our busiest time of year as we work to support our clients through all their year-end processing and annual tax form filing needs. I'd like to say a huge thank you to our more than 6,500 employees who live and represent our key values every day and who work hard to support our clients. The strong culture at Paylocity continues to be recognized externally as we were recently named by Newsweek as One of America's Greatest Workplaces for Women. I would now like to pass the call to Ryan to review the financial results in detail and provide updated fiscal 2025 guidance."}
{"doc_type": "earnings_call", "ticker": "PCTY", "period": "2025_Q3", "date": "2025-05-02", "section": "qa", "speaker": "Ryan Glenn", "text": "Thanks Toby. Q3 recurring and other revenue was $421.1 million, an increase of 15%, with total revenue up 13% from the same period last year. Our Q3 results were primarily driven by another solid quarter for our sales team, allowing us to come in $10.5 million above the top end of our total revenue guidance and resulting in a raise to our fiscal year guidance by more than our quarterly beat for the third consecutive quarter this year. Our adjusted gross profit was 77% for Q3, an increase of 110 basis points from Q3 of last fiscal year as we continue to focus on scaling our operational costs while maintaining industry-leading service levels. We continue to make significant investments in research and development. And to understand our total investment in R&D, it is important to combine both what we expense and what we capitalize. On a dollar basis, our year-over-year investment in total R&D increased by 14.6% when compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2024. And we remain focused on making investments in R&D as we continue to build out the Paylocity platform to serve the needs of the modern workforce. In regard to our go-to-market activities on a non-GAAP basis, sales and marketing expenses were 18.2% of revenue in Q3. On a non-GAAP basis, G&A costs were 8.4% of revenue in the third quarter. Our adjusted EBITDA for the third quarter was $197.1 million or 43.4% of revenue for the quarter and well exceeded the high end of our guidance, while adjusted EBITDA excluding the impact of interest income on funds held for clients was $163.6 million, also significantly exceeding our guidance for Q3. Briefly covering our GAAP results. For Q3, gross profit was $324.7 million. Operating income was $127 million, and net income was $91.5 million. In regard to the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with $477.8 million in cash, cash equivalents, and invested corporate cash and $243.8 million outstanding on our credit facility related to the Airbase acquisition with approximately $81 million repaid on our outstanding balance in Q3. Additionally, given the confidence we have in our business and our strong cash flows, we continue to utilize our share repurchase program with $84.9 million or approximately 429,000 shares of common stock repurchased in Q3 at an average price of $198.13 per share. In total, through April 30th, we have repurchased $150 million or approximately 800,000 shares of common stock this fiscal year at an average price of $190.16 per share. As a reminder, we have approximately $200 million remaining under our current share repurchase program and anticipate continuing to execute against the repurchase program going forward. In regard to client-held funds and interest income, our average daily balance of client funds was $3.6 billion in Q3. We are estimating the average daily balance will be approximately $3.1 billion in Q4 with an average annual yield of approximately 350 basis points, representing approximately $27.4 million of interest income in Q4. On a full year basis, we are estimating the average daily balance will be approximately $3 billion with an average yield of approximately 400 basis points, representing approximately $120 million of interest income. In regard to interest rates, our guidance reflects all Fed cuts to-date with an additional 25 basis point rate cut assumed in next week's FOMC meeting. Finally, I'd like to provide our financial guidance for Q4 and full fiscal 2025. Note that as a result of our strong third quarter, we are increasing our fiscal 2025 recurring and other revenue guidance by $12.5 million and our total revenue guidance by $19.5 million at the midpoint, which includes the full impact of our guidance beat in Q3 and a further increase in Q4 revenue guidance. Additionally, we continue to realize success driving increased profitability across our business, resulting in increased adjusted EBITDA guidance, which includes the full impact of our guidance beat in Q3 and increased profitability expectations for fiscal 2025. We continue to be pleased with our ability to drive operating leverage in our business with our updated guidance reflecting 100 basis points of adjusted EBITDA leverage, excluding interest income on funds held for clients, versus fiscal 2024, and representing approximately 200 basis points of organic operating leverage in fiscal 2025, well more than offsetting the approximately 100 basis point headwind in fiscal 2025 from the Airbase acquisition. With that said, for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025, recurring and other revenue is expected to be in the range of $358.1 million to $363.1 million or approximately 11% growth over fourth quarter of fiscal 2024 recurring and other revenue. And total revenue is expected to be in the range of $385.5 million to $390.5 million or approximately 9% growth over fourth quarter fiscal 2024 total revenue. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be in the range of $118.7 million to $122.7 million. And adjusted EBITDA, excluding interest income on funds held for clients, is expected to be in the range of $91.3 million to $95.3 million. And for fiscal year 2025, we are increasing all aspects of our guidance as follows. Recurring and other revenue is now expected to be in the range of $1.460 billion to $1.465 billion or approximately 14% growth over fiscal 2024 recurring and other revenue. Total revenue is expected to be in the range of $1.580 billion to $1.585 billion or approximately 13% growth over fiscal 2024. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be in the range of $571 million to $575 million. And adjusted EBITDA, excluding interest income on funds held for clients, is expected to be in the range of $451 million to $455 million. In conclusion, we are pleased with our Q3 results and the momentum we have across our sales and operations teams as we head into the final quarter of the year. Operator, we are now ready for questions."}

My first question, Steve, is about a comment that you made around future modules maybe not being in a PEPY kind of model. I guess how does that change your conversations with customers? HR -- and I know you're starting to do more outside of just the traditional HR role, but I think about how HR managers kind of think about managing their budget, historically been a very much a per-employee basis conversation. Do some of the things that you're bringing to the market today, does it really change that conversation? Is it something that they're kind of accustomed to? Maybe help us think about how that might be different."}
{"doc_type": "earnings_call", "ticker": "PCTY", "period": "2025_Q3", "date": "2025-05-02", "section": "qa", "speaker": "Steve Beauchamp", "text": "Yes, it's a good question, Scott. I think you're right. The HR buyers are definitely used to per employee per month translating to a per employee per year model. And if you look at our HCM portfolio, that is the way we've priced it historically, and that's the way we're going to continue to price it going forward. I think the call-out is as we move into Office of the CFO, you often see per user model. There may be certain features in there that have transactional fees associated with it. And so our goal is to replicate pricing that the personas are used to, whether that's a CFO or an HR leader, and make sure that we've got a competitive solution not only with features but from a pricing perspective. And that will require different pricing models for different solutions and different personas. I don't think it's a problem from a go-to-market perspective because it's really a land-and-expand strategy that we're executing. And so our existing sales force will certainly be leading with the HCM products. We will leverage the additional products from a differentiation perspective, but I think the bigger opportunity is to sell back to the client base with those products, which would be a different sales force."}

I think you can always get a little bit of timing within the fiscal year relative to some of the hiring but then some of the non-labor expenses as well. I think if you look at for the first nine months of the year, R&D spend is up really consistent with revenue growth in the low teens. Sales and marketing spend, I think, is about 12% first nine months of the year. So a little bit of timing. I wouldn't read into that other than just about when the costs may come in throughout the fiscal year."}

I mean I think from a macro standpoint, we've seen things be -- I think if you go back to the end of last fiscal year, we would have said things were starting to stabilize. And I think that was the case in the first two quarters of this fiscal year. I think what we started to see in Q3 was probably some continuation of that stability. But I think there's definitely starting to be some reflection of that in some of the deals. And I think that goes back to a little bit of what we would have seen last year where you just started to see a little bit of pause entering into the mindset of buyers. And I think I wouldn't lean into that too far, but I think that's some of what we're starting to see again in the market. But I think in Q3, I mean, still strong performance, and I think had a really good January and pleased with overall with how the team executed through the course of the quarter and up to this point in the year."}

I mean I think -- if you think about how we came into this fiscal year, the situation wasn't entirely different. And I think we came in with a focus on slightly lower headcount growth and the view that we'd be able to drive productivity throughout the course of the year. And I think that's really what we've been able to do so far in the first three quarters of fiscal 2025, and I think our mindset is probably in a similar spot, at least at this point at the very start of Q4. But like I said, we're kind of going through the cycle right now of putting the plans together. And I think overall, I would just say I feel pretty good about how we've executed from a go-to-market perspective throughout the course of the first three quarters."}

And I think the investments that we've made, particularly in the enterprise part of the market for us, have really been paying off. And I think you saw a lot of that coming through in the strength that we had in January. But I think it's -- we're kind of in the early days of what I described, and no other real comments."}

So as I look at client workforce levels, they're actually up a touch year-over-year. We're seeing some of the same seasonal growth that we would see in a normal cycle where some of the clients that have seasonal employees are hiring in that April and May, June timeframe. So I agree with Toby's point, but I think at the same time, within the client base, we are seeing a lot of stability and seeing some of that natural seasonal movement that we would typically see."}

And maybe just a follow-up, Ryan, on the margins.

And that's on the back of fiscal 2024 where we had 280 basis points of operating EBITDA leverage. So tremendous amount of leverage we've driven across the business, particularly over the last 24 months. Would certainly not expect to drive that level of overperformance in the normal cycle. And I think we've always thought about this on really a multiyear basis. So you may enter periods where you have a little bit of incremental investment across the business, especially when you significantly overperformed. So, we'll keep all of those elements in mind as we think about what 2026 and beyond would look like. But no question, over the medium and long-term, we continue to have a lot of confidence in our ability to drive adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow margins higher as the business continues to scale."}

But is that point in time based on what you've already experienced?

So I think to my comments a minute ago, we're seeing a lot of stability in the client base. I agree with Toby's comments that we're certainly seeing the volatility out there. There's some level of uncertainty, but would not say that there's been any material impact to the momentum we've seen in the business for the first nine months of the year. So, I feel like we've taken all the factors into account and feel really good about the Q4 guidance. And I think similar setup to how we've talked about the first three quarters of the year, which is feel like that's a prudent level of guidance. And if the team continues to deliver strong results, we'd be in a position to potentially beat and raise."}

I mean I think what you're seeing from us is a focus on really being able to drive productivity. And I think part of -- a big part of the sales and marketing line is certainly our sales headcount. And we came into this year with a lower level of growth in overall headcount year-to-year than we would have the prior few years. And I think our ability to hold that line from an expense standpoint and produce the results that we're putting up for the first three quarters of the year are broadly reflective of our focus this year just on trying to drive a higher level of productivity. So, I know there's a few parts to your question, but that would be the overall sort of sentiment in terms of how we came into the year, the investments that we were making and what we thought we'd be able to produce with those investments."}

You mentioned early in the call that Airbase is fully integrated and the value is resonating.

And can you quantify a little bit what the contribution is from a top line perspective?

As you know, it typically will take us 12 or 18 months before we phase in an integrated offering. And we're making good progress on that front, and we're excited about that opportunity. But the great part about Airbase is it's a great product on a stand-alone basis. And so we've been able to continue to sell that in the market. In some cases, those are Paylocity customers. In other cases, they're not Paylocity -- existing Paylocity customers. And so that has gone probably slightly better than our expectations. At the same time, we think the bigger opportunity still stands in front of us. And that's as we complete integration, which will certainly happen in phases, the value proposition becomes even stronger because we start to leverage the data set across the combined portfolio. And as we've had conversations and some of those sales going back to the client base, the idea of being able to have all of your spend in a single spot and track it and manage it with the same workflows, leveraging employee of record, all of that message is resonating. So, I would tell you, we're probably waiting to push too hard on that until we get past this first phase of integration. That will happen over several phases. But early signs in terms of are we happy with the product that we bought, is it resonating the market, the answer is absolutely yes."}

And I think our strategy around being a really good and value-added partner to brokers is no different today than it's ever been. I think you've seen us remain committed to our investments in those channels, to our investments with those brokers. And I think our message to the broker community has been one of consistency and one of true partnership, whether that's from a technology perspective or otherwise. And I think that message has continued to resonate in the market in the face of some industry events with consolidation where they might face different challenges or some disruption. And I think we're sort of the steady hand in all that to partner with them throughout whatever it is they might experience. And I think that's broadly been our message to the market. That's been our message to brokers. And I think that has resonated particularly well over the last handful of months."}

We really look at the opportunity from an AI is really embedding use cases across our product that will make our customers more efficient, add additional context and insight, make it easier to find their way across the applications. There's just so many use cases. And so we are definitely seeing an increase in the number of use cases. I mentioned a couple in the prepared remarks in terms of employee use cases, where they can get answers to things that they might have to hunt for in a handbook and have that instantaneously available on a chatbot-type interaction. We're also seeing pretty significant increase in utilization just in our chatbot utilization, which is really the clients themselves, asking questions, using it for way finding, finding insights. And we're also excited about bringing third-party data into the equation, so we can deliver additional insights. So employees can reference compliance-oriented information. Rather than going online, they can do it right in our product in another type of interaction. And so you'll see this across our platform, whether it's in scheduling plus and pre-populating schedules. Our strategy is to embed AI in as many use cases as possible. And we think that's the right way to approach a modern platform. And it also doesn't create angst and anxiety when you do it that way. It's not like you've got the side AI thing that is an overlay. It's actually embedded in things that you do, and it makes their everyday lives easier. And for us, that we think that's a big opportunity."}

We've always characterized that as total PEPY. And that's because we price it on a per employee per month, so it's pretty easy to understand. I think what we're trying to emphasize here is the actual growth in average revenue per client becomes an even more important metric for us going forward because not all of our products are actually going to be priced on a PEPY basis. And so that will happen with this horizontal expansion into other areas. But by no means do we think that takes away from the opportunity for us to further expand both existing products into HCM as well as add new SKUs to HCM. So, really we're going to try to do both of those things."}

And I think we've, as I said, executed on that playbook. So, it is everything from being able to take advantage of economies of scale with third party and software spend as our business grows, being able to reduce manual effort, being able to make sure that we're really putting the dollars to the best use. And obviously, having strong revenue performance as well helps gross margin, too. So I feel good about the progress we made.

And a large -- the majority of the revenue really in Airbase is software-oriented revenue. So, we don't necessarily see any material impact at the moment from any macro changes. And of course, we haven't really seen macro changes yet. So, I think overall, both HCM and Airbase, we've sold in different markets, whether that's growth markets or whether you got flat markets or whether you've got recession. I think the value proposition historically has resonated, and I'm pretty confident that Airbase will as well."}

Thanks for taking our question. Another one on the macro, perhaps from a slightly different angle. It does seem like we're all operating in a tougher and more uncertain macro, particularly relative to last year. And you've been through various cycles in the past. And probably, could you speak to any learnings that you've had on what resonates more in this sort of environment? And given the likely heightened focus on cost control for your customers, do you see an opportunity to lean more heavily on the Office of the CFO side?

And so do you lean sometimes a little bit more on the engagement side versus the efficiency? You certainly do. Different customers have different priorities. But we're in a great position because we can really help them solve either and/or both. And so you do see sometimes with certain customers where they are maybe more focused on the ROI that they're going to get the efficiency. We don't feel like we have to make changes from a scripting or sales force training. I think we're pretty equipped to do that. That's something that we do on a regular basis. As you mentioned, we've seen different cycles in our past.

And then I think when you overlay a lot of the comments that Steve has made with respect to our product momentum, whether that's in the context of some of our really exciting AI initiatives or whether that's in the context of being able to lean into Airbase and that product set more as we get into fiscal 2026. And I think that's probably the combination that is -- that's the opportunity that's before us to continue delivering in fiscal 2025 and the path that we've been on but then I think probably lean into some of those things a little bit harder yet as we kick off 2026.

Those have all continued to do well at higher penetration rates over time. I think we're very early on some of the newest products when you think about the Office of the CFO. So, I think FY 2026 becomes a year where we start to measure greater success as we start to roll out integration between the two platforms.

So, we have had a model historically where our outside sales force is largely in charge of landing new customers and new units. We get them implemented. We get them onboarded, hopefully, with as many products as they need. And then over time, those customers often find that they're very comfortable with Paylocity, doing a great job from a service perspective, and they add additional products over time. We will really, from an Airbase perspective, look for both opportunities. So we will look for our sales team to identify need upfront, and then we'll have experts that will be inside that will help navigate that purchase process for the customer. And then at the same time, we'll have those same folks be calling back into the customer and then being able to add that on. We think that some of that purchase might happen at the same time, but realistically, they'll probably have different implementation time frames. So you end up with some different expert resources, which is the same way we do things like TPA and other products. So it's a model that we've run for many years and we feel very comfortable with."}

I think as Toby said, I think we would put this in the qualitative bucket. As we talk to kind of the sales reps and we're looking for some decisions, they would have examples here and there where people are -- based on uncertainty in the overall macro market, it's been sometimes a little bit harder to get decision. It's a fairly recent comment. You obviously don't see any of that in our results, and we feel pretty confident that is not going to impact our next quarter. But I think it's just natural with, I think, some of the uncertainty in the market that you would hear that. But we certainly don't think that, that has any impact to the results so far or the guidance that we gave."}

And I think that started with coming into the year with a fair amount of momentum from a go-to-market perspective. I think the sales team did a great job in selling season. I think you saw really strong performance from our ops teams in terms of getting new business started in January and supporting our clients in the busiest time of their years from a December, January perspective. And I think that all came together to produce what we saw in the quarter, which again, I think we feel really good about in terms of how we're executing across the business."}

And then it sounds like things have been going fairly well for Airbase thus far. I know you're still largely selling that on a stand-alone basis.

That would be helpful. Thanks."}

So, I think there's various parts to the value proposition that resonate. So, there is this opportunity for them to manage their spend, provide the rules and automation so that all of that spend can be managed. And there's an ROI on that, right? They can manage that spend down. I think there's also efficiencies that can be gained in terms of closing their books, integrating into their general ledger. We integrate a lot with general ledger from a payroll perspective, so this is obviously a different type of transaction. But that has also really been valuable. And then there's an employee experience component to it, which is virtual cards and card payment and being able to make sure that that's super easy and easy for them to then create expense reports. And so I think those are probably maybe the three highlights that I would surface when we got feedback from our sales team who are having these conversations with the customers. And I think in many cases, all of those value propositions get even better as we integrate the platforms."}

So, on next earnings call, we'll obviously give formal guidance for Q1 of 2026 and full year.

Obviously, we have a different level of prudence when you think about what an annual guide might look like versus a near-term quarter. But I think similar to how we played out this year, we will take all those data points into account over the next handful months and provide you more detail on the Q4 call."}

Thanks for taking the questions. So I want to touch on the pricing dynamics a little bit. And how are you approaching the integration of CFO office products into the broader platform from a pricing perspective given the different pricing models involved? And how confident do you feel about your current pricing structure against competitive offerings and potentially market uncertainties around the macro?"}
{"doc_type": "earnings_call", "ticker": "PCTY", "period": "2025_Q3", "date": "2025-05-02", "section": "qa", "speaker": "Steve Beauchamp", "text": "Sure. So, I think just overall pricing, the market is competitive, certainly. It has been for a long time. I wouldn't call it any change to that competitive environment, and we haven't seen anything abnormal from a pricing perspective. And so we feel good about the price point and the value that we're offering to customers. And I would call it no change there. I think the reason that we mentioned this in the prepared remarks is, in Airbase, those products are definitely priced differently than HCM products. So, our goal is to replicate a competitive pricing model when we approach Office of the CFO, just like our competitors would have, versus trying to force-fit something into an HCM pricing model. We are already doing that. It's in market that is resonating pretty well. And then as we integrate the platform, you would just end up with HCM pricing that would be by module on a per employee per month basis, and then potentially a different pricing model depending on the product set in the Office of the CFO is something that we feel fairly comfortable being able to manage and already have had these conversations with customers because you have different bio personas, and it's the way they expect it to be priced. It has gone relatively smooth."}

We came into this fiscal year with about 8% rep headcount growth. And I think our focus at the time that we described was coming in feeling good about the new hire class that we had in and really believing that we had an opportunity to drive efficiency and productivity across the sales team. I think that's what we've been able to deliver so far throughout the course of the fiscal year. And I think our general viewpoint would be very similar as a starting point, is we're still finalizing the plans of how we would go into fiscal 2026. But I wouldn't call out any major change in terms of how we're thinking about that approach."}

I wanted to just ask a quick follow-up to Jason's question about growth rates on a go-forward basis. Are you looking to have the same level of beat and raise cadence in fiscal 2026 as you initially set fiscal 2025 guidance to have? And then I got a quick follow-up."}
{"doc_type": "earnings_call", "ticker": "PCTY", "period": "2025_Q3", "date": "2025-05-02", "section": "qa", "speaker": "Ryan Glenn", "text": "Yes. Hey Allan, I think the way -- we're pleased with how fiscal 2025 has played out. Obviously, as we've talked about through the now 3 earnings calls of this fiscal year, we've had a lot of sales momentum overperformance from that team. And you've seen that result in upwards of $50 million increase to recurring revenue guidance from what we provided today versus August. Obviously, a piece of that is Airbase, but the majority of that is going to be overperformance in the sales team. So, wouldn't necessarily start a fiscal year expecting that level of overperformance. But if you step back and think about guidance philosophy, yes, we would expect to have a very similar cadence next fiscal year. As I mentioned on my earlier comment, you have more visibility to the near-term quarter, so that one may result in slightly higher guidance. And then when you're thinking about guiding 12 months out, you obviously have an incremental level of prudence or conservatism because of the uncertainty that comes with guiding further out. So we, again, we'll take all those into account and provide more detail on the next call."}

And then on Airbase, you previously mentioned about two-thirds of the $22 million fiscal 2025 recurring revenue guide increase was attributed to Airbase. So, about $15 million.

{"doc_type": "earnings_call", "ticker": "PCTY", "period": "2025_Q3", "date": "2025-05-02", "section": "qa", "speaker": "Steve Beauchamp", "text": "Sure. Yes. So, I think it's, on a stand-alone basis, a very strong product set that has gotten good feedback in the marketplace. It's definitely targeted at much more of our average-sized customer. So if you think of our average-size customer being over 100 employees, and obviously, we have different segments. But the overlay of their customer base really is at the core of our market. And they've got the feature sets associated with that customer size in terms of things that CFOs would be looking for, efficiencies that it drives, some of the rules that can be more complex. So we feel really good about that. I think the other thing is there's an employee experience element to this. So employees are using the cards. They're accessing this information. They're providing -- they're submitting for approvals. More and more spend is being driven at an employee level. We have a ton of utilization on our mobile app already for core things like either punching in, checking your check, PTO. So when you can really mirror this employee experience with all the features that exist with Airbase and then be able to, on the back end, give them that single pane of glass from a reporting perspective, we think that actually ends up being a pretty unique value proposition as we complete all the phases of integration, and we start to sell it more as a unified platform."}

Our solid results continued in Q2 of fiscal 2024, with total revenue growth of 20% as our differentiated value proposition of providing the most modern software in the industry continues to resonate in the marketplace. Recurring and other revenue was $298.4 million or 16% growth over Q2 of last year. We continue to receive positive client feedback on our modern product suite, including newer products such as advanced scheduling, learning management, rewards and recognition and employee voice. Specifically, a client in the automotive industry with over 1,000 employees highlighted how the ability to create custom recognition awards that are shareable via the mobile app is positively impacting employee sentiment by making it easier for employees to celebrate one another in new ways. Similarly, a retail client with 900 employees has created over 200 custom trainings with our learning management module to better connect employees to the company's vision, mission and core values. Additionally, we continue to invest and build upon our AI leadership in the HCM industry with the launch of AI-driven personalized learning plans, optimized workforce schedules and embedded generative AI recommendation within rewards and recognition, employee voice and community. Building upon the generative AI-driven announcement and job description released in community and recruiting last calendar year, these new features help to further improve business efficiency, communication and the end user experience for our clients. While we are pleased with our Q2 results, the macro environment has become increasingly challenging over the last few months as employment levels on the platform once again moderated versus our expectations and presented an incremental headwind to results in the quarter and to fiscal 2024 guidance. Despite the macro challenges, we continue to invest in our product suite and this commitment to product innovation continues to be recognized by third parties as Paylocity was recently awarded a Bronze Brandon Hall Group Excellence in Technology Award in the Best Advance in Employee Engagement Technology category, and named as overall leader in 10 HCM product category in G2's Winter 2023 Grid Reports, marking the 21st consecutive quarter in which Paylocity achieved leader ranking. I would now like to pass the call to Toby to provide further color on the quarter."}

This is a very busy time of year for all of our teams across the business as they work closely with clients on year-end processing of payrolls, W-2s, 1095s and annual tax form filings to federal state and local agencies and on the implementation of new clients. I want to thank all of our employees for their hard work and dedication to our clients during this very busy year-end season. Building on Steve's comments around product innovation, in early December, we announced the acquisition of Trace, which enables organizations to manage headcount plans, forecast headcount budgets and approved headcount changes. When combined with the valuable employee record data in our platform, we believe Trace's headcount planning capabilities will help our clients improve decision-making and drive faster execution. From a financial perspective, Trace will not materially contribute to revenue or impact our overall margin profile in fiscal 2024. With respect to our go-to-market efforts, we've realized significant success in the upper end of our target market over the last several fiscal years, and we have invested to grow the size of that team. To date, in fiscal 2024, we've seen sales cycles upmarket take longer, and it has taken longer for our new reps to ramp up which has pressured productivity and new sales volumes in January and has weighed on fiscal 2024 growth. That said, we remain confident in our sales team and go-to-market motion, and we are pleased by our top of funnel activity, the growth of the upmarket pipeline and our ability to drive product differentiation upmarket. We will be focusing the rest of this year and going into next year on driving a higher level of go-to-market productivity and driving execution upmarket. We have remained focused on our referral channels and have been pleased with the consistency of our referrals, which once again delivered more than 25% of our new business in Q2. We have also continued to drive leverage across the business as we grow and scale with focus on both EBITDA and free cash flow leverage this quarter and this fiscal year. The strong culture at Paylocity continues to be recognized externally as we recently were named to Newsweek's America's Greatest Workplaces for Diversity in 2024 and built-ins list of the 100 best large companies to work for in Chicago for 2023. I would now like to pass the call to Ryan to review the financial results in detail and provide updated fiscal 2024 guidance."}

On a dollar basis, our year-over-year investment in total R&D increased by 27% when compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2023 and as we continue to build out the Paylocity platform to serve the needs of the modern workforce. In regards to our go-to-market activities. On a non-GAAP basis, sales and marketing expenses were 21.3% of revenue in the second quarter versus 23.7% in the second quarter of last year. On a non-GAAP basis, G&A costs were 9.1% of revenue in the second quarter versus 11.3% in the same period last year, and we remain focused on consistently leveraging our G&A expenses on an annual basis. Our adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter was $112.6 million or 34.5% margin and exceeded the top end of our guidance by $9.6 million and represented 620 basis points of leverage versus Q2 of fiscal 2023. We continue to be pleased by our ability to drive increased profitability through leverage and adjusted gross margin, adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow while also maintaining strong revenue growth. Briefly covering our GAAP results. For Q2, gross profit was $219 million. Operating income was $49.7 million and net income was $38.1 million. In regard to the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $366.9 million and no debt outstanding. In regard to client-held funds and interest income, our average daily balance of client funds was $2.4 billion in Q2. We are estimating the average daily balance will be approximately $2.9 billion in Q3 with an average annual yield of approximately 450 basis points. On a full-year basis, we are estimating the average daily balance will be approximately $2.5 billion to $2.6 billion with an average yield of approximately 445 to 450 basis points. Please note, our guidance includes the impact of a contemplated 25 basis point decline in the Fed funds rate in May. In regard to client workforce levels, year-over-year employees on the platform growth came in below our expectations in Q2, resulting in an incremental headwind to the quarter and fiscal year. Given recent macroeconomic trends, our updated guidance for the back half of fiscal 2024 includes further moderation in client workforce levels through the remainder of the fiscal year. Finally, I'd like to provide our financial guidance for Q3 and full fiscal 2024. For the third quarter of fiscal 2024, total revenue is expected to be in the range of $395 million to $399 million or approximately 17% growth over third quarter fiscal 2023 total revenue. And adjusted EBITDA is expected to be in the range of $153.5 million to $156.5 million. And for fiscal year 2024, total revenue is expected to be in the range of $1.384 billion to $1.389 billion or approximately 18% growth over fiscal 2023. And adjusted EBITDA is expected to be in the range of $474 million to $478 million, which represents 240 basis points of leverage over fiscal 2023. Operator, we are now ready for questions."}

Thanks for taking our questions. Just starting off here, what are you seeing in terms of unit growth or any potential churn with customers at the low end of the market? One of your public competitors noted an elevated level of churn with customers under 50 employees. Are you seeing anything there? Or is it really simply just a matter of customers across the board regardless of size, lowering their employment levels across all customer segments?"}
{"doc_type": "earnings_call", "ticker": "PCTY", "period": "2024_Q2", "date": "2024-02-08", "section": "qa", "speaker": "Steve Beauchamp", "text": "Yes. I think the impact that we're seeing is our current customers are not necessarily getting the growth of employees on the platform that you would typically see in this type of economic environment. And so we certainly factored that in, in terms of what we've seen already this year and then assumed that that was going to continue to be the case for the back half of the year. So that's the headwind that I think Ryan referred to in the script. You typically see customers under 50 employees, they naturally turn over at a higher rate just because there's more out of business losses. That trend is probably something that's always been the case in our industry. And so if you were growing that segment more and you were losing more there, that probably just is the nature of the business under 50 market. I don't think we've seen anything in that space that would be any different than before. And I think an economy that's growing and fairly consistent in terms of employment levels, nothing to call out in that space."}

Yes, I think if you go back over probably the last, call it, 18 months to two years, we've talked about getting a traction upmarket and we've talked about having incremental success there from a sales perspective. And I think that's been the case. And I think we've also invested more across the business and in go-to-market to support the growth that we've seen there. And as we've called out, I think last quarter, we called out that we were seeing slightly slower sales cycles, I think we saw the same thing this quarter. And I think that was the reason why we put it in the script. I think it's hard to take a part with any precision, what part of that because I know others in the space have talked about this, too, and you've on and off heard it in the broader software category in terms of upmarket sales cycles being longer. It's hard to take a part how much of that is attributable to the macro. I don't think the macro helps. But I think part of it is, I think as we've sort of gotten further and further into the upmarket, I think we certainly have an opportunity to execute better. And I think that will be a focus as we look at the rest of this fiscal year to be able to drive productivity and I think that will carry into next fiscal, too."}

Maybe the first one, as you – maybe to piggyback on Brad's question about the upmarket, does it make you think that you need a different type of either sales reps? Or I guess, can you help us understand maybe what has made it more difficult for them to be able to ramp? And does it, do you need to hire different types of reps there than it historically done in the core sales organization? Maybe walk us through that?"}
{"doc_type": "earnings_call", "ticker": "PCTY", "period": "2024_Q2", "date": "2024-02-08", "section": "qa", "speaker": "Steve Beauchamp", "text": "Yes. I think it's a good question. So we've been ramping the number of reps in that space, as Toby just mentioned faster than the rest of our sales force over the last, call it, two to three years. We've called out the fact that success in that market has been a tailwind for us over the last couple of fiscal years. Early on in that cycle, you get a lot of promotions from within. It's very common to be able to do that as you start to ramp to bigger numbers, you're certainly bringing more people in from the outside. So I think part of this is figuring out how long does it take someone to ramp from the outside versus internal. And then I think secondly, when you start to get higher volume of deals in that space, trying to understand what those sales cycles look like and the decision-making cycle. So there certainly is a little bit of learning at scale that's going on here. But I would reiterate the fact that we've had a lot of success. It's been a tailwind for us over the last couple of years, a little bumpier here on the first half of this year, but the pipeline looks pretty rich and strong. And we think we know what we have to do to continue to get success in that market going forward."}

Just as I think about the guidance, how much of it was maybe the sluggishness that you've seen upmarket versus the trend in employment in the base coming in differently than expectations?

I think when you think about the revised guidance for this fiscal year, I think it's absolutely a combination of what Steve and Toby have referenced relative to sales execution. So that's certainly part of it. And I think an equal part of it has been some of the challenges we've seen from a macro standpoint, both year-to-date as well as the fact that we factored in some further moderation in the back half of the year. So I think both of those contributed fairly equally to the revised guidance. Relative to what that implies for Q4, obviously, as I referenced, we had some further moderation in employment levels. That puts you in the sort of 13% or so range for exit of Q4, and I think we'll see how the back half of the year goes before we guide more specifically into 2025."}

Steve and Toby, I'm wondering how deeply do you analyze the trend of the employees that are on the system? I mean do you break it out internally for yourselves by industry? Do you break it out by geo and you break it out by segment? And because UKG started disclosing that and they're private, so they can do it, right? But I assume you guys have that level of detail, too. And I'm just wondering, so where was the weakness?"}
{"doc_type": "earnings_call", "ticker": "PCTY", "period": "2024_Q2", "date": "2024-02-08", "section": "qa", "speaker": "Steve Beauchamp", "text": "So we do all of those things, and we look at it a variety of different ways. I would tell you that not – there wasn't a big spike in a specific geo or a specific vertical market. I think your higher hourly employee segments when you think of vertical markets, we saw a little bit higher decline in those segments if you think of vertical markets. Geos, there really wasn't much, a call out at all. And so it was generally kind of across the board just a little bit of weakness. But when you add that up across all the customers that we have and you factor that in, it starts to have an impact, especially when it's happened month after month this fiscal year."}

I had a question and a follow-up. Just kind of building on the last couple of questions. I think you guys are articulating that there might be some macro stuff here, but also execution stuff. Can you share a little bit more how you're thinking about with a couple of quarters left, what you can do on the execution side, whether it's org or leadership changes? And then the second question, maybe if I could just go ahead and ask it, and I can repeat it if you all forget is, have you all maybe over-indexed on the upmarket activity? Because there is lots of smaller employers under 500 employees. Is there any way – I know it's easier said than done, a bit of a pivot to that market? Or is that market just less active? Thank you."}

I think we've got the team in place. When we look at what we've got from a pipeline perspective and we look at all of our internal metrics, we feel pretty confident that the ability to execute sits in front of us, big market, great product in terms of receptivity. And so we feel pretty good about that. We have grown pretty fast to your second question, in upmarket. Maybe hindsight's 20/20, it's hard to say that's been a great tailwind for us over the last two or three fiscal years. So hard to actually say that wasn't successful. Did it create some bumps in the road maybe early on in this fiscal year, yes. But the product is being received really well in the marketplace. The pipeline is really, really strong. We've got a great group of people that we feel like have been productive and will continue to be productive, and we've got to focus on execution in terms of what's in front of us."}

But just Steve, just a real quick kind of follow-up because one thing you did note is the pipeline. I mean, if these deals are closing, that they just stay in the pipeline. I'm just curious, do these folks though at some point just kind of slow down or just cut it off and then you have to kind of get in the new sales cycle with them into next year? Or could some of these larger deals actually play out in the next couple of quarters? I'm just trying to understand how some of these larger deals could potentially play out because this is a newer business for you. So maybe you don't have pattern recognition? Thank you."}

I think we've been in this space for a while, but really more of the last three fiscal years kind of in earnest where we've been expanding more significantly. And as I mentioned earlier, we've ramped the reps up more significantly over probably the last two years with more hires from outside of the industry. So we do continue to learn. I think you see many people in this space talk about a long-dated sales cycle. So I think there's a macro element to that. That's certainly the feedback that we hear from our reps, which is just taking a little bit longer to get the decisions. We look at both top of funnel pipeline as well as late-stage pipeline, and we see pretty strong activity all the way through. So that gives us confidence that we've got an opportunity to be able to push some of those deals through on the back half of the year and have a better back half than we did on the front half upmarket."}

So we're not adding more in the upper end of the market relative to our core marketplace. And so we've already kind of made that shift. I think there's an opportunity for us to be able to – we're focused on an absolute new ARR number versus a specific number of reps. And if we have an opportunity to press on productivity to be able to get there, we always go there first. That's always kind of our thought process. So we won't make that decision until we go into next fiscal year. But I would say we feel pretty good about the staffing level that we've got right now. We feel good about the initiatives that we have to drive productivity, and we'll give you more color as we kind of go into next fiscal year."}

In other words, if you talk to your more experienced sales folks and if some of them are not performing as well as they previously had, are you hearing any feedback with regards to, hey, maybe the level of urgency to modernize the solution isn't quite what it was, say, three, four, five years ago because there's a greater percentage of clients that have moved to more modern solutions and most of the large legacy players have become better and have improved their solution?

I think we see fairly consistent performance there. We did call out historically, everybody was kind of seeing record high retention after – right after COVID. People definitely didn't seem to be moving quite as much. And we've certainly seen that return back to the pre-COVID levels, but I don't think there's any specific call out from a retention perspective."}

I think – so I certainly feel good about where we've driven profitability so far this fiscal year. So in second quarter, over 600 basis points of leverage on adjusted EBITDA, 470 basis points, if you strip out the impact of interest income. So we have a number of programs across the business from a efficiency and scalability perspective, reducing manual processes and making sure that we're really prioritizing spend and continue to be pleased with the output of those programs. And I think that has allowed us in a maybe more challenging year from a revenue standpoint to be able to maintain really strong profitability and in fact, actually take up margin for the fiscal year. So really happy. I think it just demonstrates the scalability and profitability of the business, and we've seen that both in adjusted EBITDA as well as in free cash flow."}

I think we're still very much in the early innings. And I think customers are also themselves trying to figure out how, in an HCM platform, AI can provide them benefit. And so we've been often first to market with many of the AI capabilities and we're definitely seeing clients use it and you get tying into the LLMs and having writing assistance and job descriptions and community. You have a much better option for personalization across the platform, easier to create recommendations based off your historical data set. Think about that like schedule recommendations that we've launched. And we've got a long list of ideas that we can enhance customer value in terms of adding AI across the platform. So that continues to be our approach versus any type of separate monetization by SKU. I also think there's a big opportunity to really enhance the client experience. Clients do call and e-mail and we interact with them a ton. There's a lot of different questions and answers. And so that's an area that we continue to invest in as well as being able to provide much better, more personalized responses to our customers over time. And so I think we've got opportunities in both categories."}

Maybe just to start maybe following up on the kind of seasonality dynamics for 3Q into 4Q. Still kind of assumes another three or four points down on the recurring and overall growth line.

I think probably the two factors I'd call out would be obviously January starts, which we've referenced in the prepared remarks and in the Q&A here. So that probably had some headwinds in it relative to upmarket. So that as a factor in the third quarter but certainly into the fourth. And the other factor would be the macro impact. So as we've referenced we did see now really two quarters of weakness sequentially, and we assumed some further moderation in the back half. So that has an impact in Q3. But as you get to the fourth quarter, that would have all the impact we've seen year-to-date as well as the additional moderation that we factored in. So I think it's really those two items that would account for that sequential slowdown in revenue growth you're referencing."}

I don't think there's a change in any guidance philosophy. I think it's a matter of how long do you see a trend, and then do you have to account for it. So I think last quarter, we kind of assumed employment stayed flat and that you wouldn't see any continued sequential decline. We've seen that now for two quarters. So we think it's prudent for us to be able to take that trend into consideration. You also – Ryan just said, he took into account potentially a rate cut, and that's obviously included as well. And so we're also in the back half of the year, so you're only talking two quarters left. So I don't think there's any different in approach, but we felt like we should at least take into account all the things that we have seen so far and that seem at least reasonably possible into the guidance."}

So maybe again, kind of similar line of questioning. It's a multiparter. The first being just if I think about the amount kind of taken out of the guide for this year, I think it's about $20 million on the recurring revenue line. Just dimensionalize like is half of that employment levels and half of that kind of either later starts or less starts. And then as we're kind of – maybe a few quarters removed from the long-term guide of 20%, given the exit rate of 12% to 13% in Q4. Is this something that's temporal and there might be kind of a year air gap until we get back to that 20% long-term target? Or are we talking more a quarter or two?"}

We made some changes going into this fiscal year. We're still focused on growth as a priority. We still think there's a lot of levers that we can pull to be able to grow the business, huge TAM, products getting great adoption, pipeline is pretty rich and full. So at this point in time, no changes and same priority growth first and continued focus at the same time on margin expansion. And that's kind of been our formula for success in the past."}

If I think about kind of everything you've referenced from on the sales go-to-market side, the execution side, what gives you kind of incremental confidence that there's also not kind of increased competitive pressure, maybe increased market saturation, that it's not those things that it really is kind of a temporal fix around both the macro current environment as well as the longer time to ramp for sales people?"}
{"doc_type": "earnings_call", "ticker": "PCTY", "period": "2024_Q2", "date": "2024-02-08", "section": "qa", "speaker": "Steve Beauchamp", "text": "Yes, I think there are several factors there. So I think, number one, it's the conversations that you have with your sales force, especially the folks that have been here around a long time and the confidence level that they have in the product and service that we're offering. And then number two, I think it's the data that we get into. And when we're looking at the pipeline, we're looking at this in detail by deal, looking at what those close ratios look like. And so if the pipeline wasn't necessarily building and we weren't seeing these elongated sales cycles, I probably would have a different answer to that question, but that's very evident in the data that we're looking at. And so that provides us more optimism. And then I think lastly, it's the conversations that we have with current customers, and we're seeing how the product is resonating in the upper end of the space, and we're certainly having success. And so I think it's when you put those three things together, we think we have an opportunity to execute better on the back half of the year. And we have a big opportunity from a TAM perspective, and that includes the success we've had over the last several years in upmarket."}

And I think the way to think about that is relative to the revised guidance. Half of that impact is macro, roughly speaking, and half of it would be some of the sales headwinds I think the way that we assume that layered in over the balance of the year is we've seen a very small but consistent decline over the last five months, and we assume that similar level of decline in further moderation happens each month into Q3 and Q4. There wasn't a particular month or quarter that we had concentration. It was assumed that continued moderation happens over the course of the back half of the year."}

So I think it's certainly been a little bit tighter economy and when we talk to our customers, and they're certainly trying to be able to manage their cost as well as the growth that they might see in their business. And so one of the challenges that our customers tell us about is people are one of the largest costs that they have. And when somebody then leaves the organization, are you going to replace them? Are you going to replace them right away? Or are you going to replace it in a different position? How do you then approve requisitions for new positions? All those concepts in a tighter economy become even more important parts of the conversation. And we have all the data about the people in our platform already. And so when you can layer in workflows and approvals for that activity to happen, you can layer forecasting capabilities, on rules and routing that becomes really attractive in terms of driving both cost efficiency for our customers as well as just purely efficiency in terms of getting those actions done where the data already exists today."}

I think that continues to be of interest to us. And I think as we get through the back half of this fiscal year, we'll continue to look at other ways to allocate capital as we go through the year.

But what I would tell you based off of our prior acquisitions is we really try to take the time to build it into our platform such that from a user perspective, you would have no idea whether we built it ourselves or we acquired it and then use that team that we acquired to build it into our platform. So we're doing that work right now, and we're figuring that out. I definitely think there's a fair amount of value in the product. So if you can save customers both time and drive more efficient process and ultimately save them people dollars, then that certainly becomes a monetizable option.

I think we've seen product take rates remain fairly consistent throughout all sort of areas of the market. And like I said earlier, I think we've also seen.

Toby mentioned, we're pretty happy with the initial take rates there. So attaching those new customers and selling those back to customers become an opportunity. Obviously, rolling into Trace and getting that product out in the market will be a future opportunity. So we're excited about what we got from a product perspective. And then I think, overall, we've got pretty significant presence both in our core market as well as upmarket. And we're getting good receptivity of those products and the enhancements that we're making to the product. So we're really leading with the most modern platform in the industry and we feel good about that. It's really up to us to be able to continue to execute. Broker channel remains really strong. We're executing really well there. So there's certainly a lot of positives. We obviously focus on this call on areas that we have opportunity to make improvements in, and we're committed to make those improvements. And our turnover rates have been really, really low. So we've got the team to be able to do it, and we've got a strong pipeline, and that's what we're going to focus on."}

Our strong sales momentum continued into fiscal 2023 with recurring revenue growth of 35.7% as our differentiated value proposition of providing the most modern software in the industry continues to resonate in the marketplace. Total revenue was $253.3 million or 39.4% growth over Q1 of last year and exceeded the top end of our guidance by $12 million. In September, we held our annual Elevate Client Conference, where we hosted a record 4,000 clients, prospects and partners for more than 100 virtual and in-person sessions over the course of two days. The prevailing topic throughout the conference was the need to leverage software tools to connect employees, processes and data more efficiently across an organization. The theme of connected HR has become increasingly important for companies as it remains difficult to find, attract, train and retain top talent in a tight labor market. At Elevate, we highlighted several new product enhancements across our suite that are specifically focused on driving a more modern connected HR experience at both the employee and company level. For employees, new tools within communities, such as the ability to create announcements through a mobile device, add multiple attachments and schedule postings in advance, will ensure clients are able to engage with their employees wherever and whenever they want. Within Premium Video, our new video hub offers a centralized location for managing, reviewing, editing and sharing engaging content, both company-wide and within a specific team. Lastly, our newly released My Insights feature allows clients to create, edit and save multiple dashboards, each dedicated to drilling down into a specific data set or use case. At Elevate, we had the opportunity to connect with clients that are leveraging many of these solutions to drive a more tightly connected HR experience, including a financial services client with 300 employees who is saving over $200,000 from operational improvements informed by our data insight tool and a manufacturing client with over 1,000 employees that is driving a 70% reduction in employee turnover through a combination of community, surveys and impressions. The strong momentum across our business continues to be recognized by third parties as Paylocity was recently named an overall leader for all 12 HRIS product categories in the G2 Fall 2022 Grid Report. This marks the 16th consecutive quarter where Paylocity has achieved the leader ranking and includes recognition across all segments. A big thank you to our employees, clients and partners for helping create the best Elevate Conference we’ve had to date, and we can’t wait to see everyone back again next year. I would now like to pass the call to Toby to provide further color on the quarter."}
{"doc_type": "earnings_call", "ticker": "PCTY", "period": "2023_Q1", "date": "2022-11-05", "section": "qa", "speaker": "Toby Williams", "text": "Thanks, Steve. The desire of our clients and their employees to drive a more connected HR experience continues to be reflected in key utilization metrics across our modern workforce solutions, including community, where in Q1, we once again saw strong growth in the number of posts, announcements and comments. We also continue to see similar trends in terms of content creation across both our Premium Video and Survey products as clients look to increasingly connect with their employees through more engaging mediums. Collectively, these trends continue to provide a catalyst for our significant sales momentum, driving strong sales execution across our entire market in Q1 and setting us up for a strong fiscal 2023 as we head through selling season. In addition to our recurring revenue growth, interest income on client funds continues to rise as a result of the sustained interest rate increases from the Federal Reserve. Given the large market opportunity in front of us, the strong execution of our sales team and the success we’re seeing in product usage and adoption, we plan to reinvest a portion of this upside back into key areas of the business, including people, product and marketing, to help drive future growth. We remain committed to continuing our investments in digital marketing and our channel initiatives, which once again delivered more than 25% of new business in Q1 as well as incremental product investments as we continue to innovate and deliver the most modern platform in the industry. We continue to see strong demand across our target market, and we’re very pleased with the momentum in our sales team coming into selling season. From a macro perspective, while we have seen a modest increase in workforce levels through October of this fiscal year, the rate of increase has leveled off, which we have reflected in our Q2 and fiscal 2023 guidance. The strong culture at Paylocity continues to be recognized externally as we receive the Great Places to Work certification for 2022 and were named to Fortune’s Best Workplaces in Chicago, Built In’s Best Places to Work in Chicago and the Best and Brightest Companies to Work For in the nation. Echoing Steve’s comments, I would like to thank all of our more than 5,000 employees for a great start to fiscal 2023. I would now like to pass the call to Ryan to review the financial results in detail and provide updated fiscal 2023 guidance."}
{"doc_type": "earnings_call", "ticker": "PCTY", "period": "2023_Q1", "date": "2022-11-05", "section": "qa", "speaker": "Ryan Glenn", "text": "Thanks, Toby. Total revenue for the first quarter was $253.3 million, an increase of 39.4%, with recurring and other revenues up 35.7% from the same period last year. As Steve noted, our sales team had a strong quarter, and we were pleased to come in $12 million above the top end of our revenue guidance. Our adjusted gross profit was 72.1% for Q1 versus 70.5% in Q1 of last year, representing 160 basis points of leverage as we continue to focus on scaling our operational costs while maintaining industry-leading service levels. We continue to make significant investments in research and development. And to understand our overall investment in R&D, it is important to combine both what we expense and what we capitalize. On a dollar basis, our year-over-year investment in total R&D increased by 44.9% when compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2022, and we remain focused on making incremental investments in R&D throughout fiscal 2023 as we continue to build out the Paylocity platform to serve the needs of the modern workforce. In regards to our go-to-market activities, on a non-GAAP basis, sales and marketing expenses were 23.9% of revenue in the first quarter, and we remain focused on making incremental investments in this area of the business in fiscal 2023 to drive continued growth. On a non-GAAP basis, G&A costs were 12.0% of revenue in the first quarter versus 13.1% in the same period last year, and we remain focused on consistently leveraging our G&A expenses on an annual basis. Our adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter was $66.6 million or 26.3% margin and exceeded the top end of our guidance by $8.6 million and represented 90 basis points of leverage versus Q1 of fiscal 2022. Briefly covering our GAAP results, for Q1, gross profit was $168.7 million, operating income was $7.1 million and net income was $30.4 million. In regards to the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $65.5 million and no debt outstanding. Additionally, in August, we increased our liquidity through expanding our existing revolving credit facility to $550 million. We’re pleased with our performance in Q1, which included another strong quarter for our sales team while also identifying opportunities to demonstrate scale and operational G&A costs, and we’re happy with the progress we made to start the year. In regard to client-held funds and interest income, our average daily balance of client funds was $2.1 billion in Q1. We are estimating the average daily balance will be approximately $2.2 billion in Q2 with an average annual yield of approximately 170 basis points. On a full year basis, we are estimating the average daily balance will be $2.4 billion with an average yield of approximately 190 basis points. Additionally, please note that our guidance includes the impact of this week’s 75 basis point interest rate increase, and it assumes 25 basis points to 50 basis points increase in December, but does not currently include any changes to interest rates in calendar 2023. Finally, I’d like to provide our financial guidance for Q2 and full fiscal 2023. For the second quarter of fiscal 2023, total revenue is expected to be in the range of $257 million to $261 million or approximately 32% growth over second quarter fiscal 2022 total revenue. And adjusted EBITDA is expected to be in the range of $63.5 million to $66.5 million. And for fiscal 2023, total revenue is expected to be in the range of $1.122 billion to $1.127 billion or approximately 32% growth over fiscal 2022. And adjusted EBITDA is expected to be in the range of $336 million to $340 million, which represents 220 basis points of leverage over fiscal 2022. In conclusion, we are pleased with our Q1 results, and we’re pleased to raise fiscal 2023 guidance to 32% revenue growth at the midpoint which, in combination with the adjusted EBITDA margin represented in our full year guide, places us above the Rule of 60 in fiscal 2023. Operator, we are now ready for questions."}

A couple here, first of all, impressive revenue beat in the quarter, your best percentage beat, as I can tell, in at least five years, and you maintained 36% recurring revenue growth against a five-point more difficult comp, so that was great. But how should we think about the strength in the business stay? Is this purely related to volume in terms of number of deals that you’re out there and winning? It continues to be really, really strong? Or is there a mix around maybe ARPU and customer size, with your added focus targeting larger customers today helping you benefit that growth?"}
{"doc_type": "earnings_call", "ticker": "PCTY", "period": "2023_Q1", "date": "2022-11-05", "section": "qa", "speaker": "Steve Beauchamp", "text": "Yes. So, I think overall, it’s really coming from the strength and execution in our sales team. And that comes from the two places you talked about, adding new customers to the platform, still the biggest driver for us, and we’re having really good success across all the markets that we serve in terms of being able to do that. And I think the second point you bring up is average revenue per customer has been increasing, and we continue to get momentum from that. And that happens in a couple of different ways. First, having new products and selling more of those products both back to existing customers and new customers. And then, on top of that, the upmarket initiative that we’ve been talking about over the last year continues to be successful. So, you see some of those larger clients having an impact to that average revenue per customer as well."}

And I guess someone’s got to ask the macro question at least. Even a couple of reports I have tonight and others over the last two weeks, SMB in certain areas has certainly shown some weakness out there. You all service the market that’s kind of SMB. I think the low end of the enterprise is squarely in what part of that segment. You all aren’t seeing any pressure there? Are you seeing any changes that might be interesting to call out? The numbers suggest no, but I had to ask it."}

No, it’s obviously an important question in this type of climate. What I would tell you from a demand perspective, obviously, we’re really happy with the results, and we’ve got a lot of sales momentum inside our selling season right now. As you know, January is a big time for starts. So no evidence of slowdown from that perspective. And then I think the other part is looking at our clients. And as we mentioned in the prepared remarks, we did have a little bit more employees on the platform when you look at kind of a same-store sales measurement, although that has slowed pretty significantly versus prior periods. But it is still slightly positive. And so it seems like the clients that we have are pretty resilient at the moment."}

{"doc_type": "earnings_call", "ticker": "PCTY", "period": "2023_Q1", "date": "2022-11-05", "section": "qa", "speaker": "Steve Beauchamp", "text": "So our client base is pretty diverse with over 30,000 customers, really representing all industries. We do try to slice it and dice it and look at it in different ways. There’s really not much to call out at all realistically. It’s been pretty consistent across the board. There are some variations in the industries that you kind of might expect, but it is relatively small. And overall, as we looked at the current situation, we included that in the guidance. So, we certainly didn’t think that, that was going to change going forward, and it’s, overall, pretty moderate, fairly flat."}

I think just from our perspective, we had put the original credit facility in place a few years back and just what was there as part of the capital structure as we have continued to grow and scale the business. And I think what you saw us doing was reflecting nothing more than sort of an update of that, reflecting the growth that we’ve seen in the business. So, we upsized that, but I think rationale is the same, no different. And it was upsizing that, I think, somewhat opportunistically just given the growth and the size and scale of the business."}

{"doc_type": "earnings_call", "ticker": "PCTY", "period": "2023_Q1", "date": "2022-11-05", "section": "qa", "speaker": "Steve Beauchamp", "text": "Sure. So, you think about it from both a manager and employee user. So, we’ve got millions of employee users on the platform. They use it for a wide variety of capabilities. And most of that activity today, more of that activity happens on mobile than it does on the web. And they can do pretty much anything they can do on the web on mobile. When it comes to the administrator and the HR administrator, there’s definitely capabilities they take advantage on our mobile application, but if you’re thinking about bigger, more complicated things, running payrolls, managing your payroll, you’ve got customers who have to do complex approvals and workflows, a lot of that still occurs on the web, mostly because of preference in terms of where you can actually most efficiently get that done. But part of our strategy long term is to continue to invest in mobile first and everything that we build can be done on your phone. And increasingly so, we’re seeing more and more of our clients, employees and managers do most of their activities from a mobile perspective. So that continues to be an area of an R&D investment going forward."}

And so we’ve more than doubled the amount of product that we can sell since our IPO. And we’ve got a pretty robust road map of new initiatives that we’re working on. And things like collaboration, the ability to automate your workflows, those are concepts that are going to be an important part of our new product strategy. We don’t have a habit of announcing those products until they’re ready and in market and till we actually get feedback from our clients. And we really believe strongly as client is a co-creator. So, I think thematically, you’re on the right idea. Collaboration, workflows, automation is definitely there, and we are pretty excited about some of the initiatives we’ve got in flight. Our clients are taking advantage of some of the fillable forms capabilities. You see that often in our onboarding application is probably the primary place, but they’re also using that in workflows today."}

I would say from a macro perspective, there’s not a lot of change. It is a competitive environment. We typically are competing against one, two, maybe even three different providers as we are winning deals and bringing clients over to the market. We see the biggest players the most, just like you would expect. I don’t think it’s any different than the market share that they have. We feel like we’ve got a differentiated value proposition. We’ve got modern capabilities that don’t exist in any of our competitive set, and we think that our ability to back that up and partner with our clients, that’s the key part to the value proposition. And we’ve been able to be very successful, obviously, with the revenue growth that we were posting here, not being able to win clients in all markets, but nothing new from a competitive perspective."}

And then, I guess, kind of looking further back at 2008 and the Great Recession impact on Ultimate Software. We saw about four quarters of decreased growth in 2008 through early 2009.

I mean I think the best sort of guidepost for anything like that is really what we’ve just come through from a pandemic perspective. I mean, obviously, the cause of the macroeconomic impact was different. But I think what you saw from us through the course of the pandemic was, first of all, commitment to our employees and our clients. And I think what you also saw from us was running the business fairly consistently with how we had been preceding the pandemic in terms of continuing to hire across the business, continuing to invest for future growth in product and sales and marketing and operations and really across the whole business. So I think where we sit today, we feel like we just had a really strong quarter. We’re really pleased with the sales execution that we’re seeing, the competitive dynamics in the market that Steve referenced and the differentiation really resonating with our clients and prospects. And so I think despite any macroeconomic uncertainty, I think we would approach it in very much the same way we did throughout the course of the pandemic with a lot of consistency and continuing to invest in the business for future growth."}

So obviously, we continue to grow, and we’re looking for great people to join our teams, and that’s across the board. So sales certainly are hiring. It’s not our primary hiring season for sales. We typically really ramp that up after year-end, but opportunistically, we’re bringing people on all the time. I would say, across the board, including sales, we’re really happy with our ability to have a value proposition for employees that they’re excited about and getting really talented people to come onboard in a still fairly competitive market. So that includes places like research and development and sales and a lot of our teams that have to support our customers. So staffing levels are strong going into year-end, which is important because it’s a really busy time of year. And I think from a sales perspective, we’ve got a nice head start before we really start to ramp up hiring after year-end."}

If I take a look at the gross margins, your adjusted gross margins and I back out the contribution from float, it looks like the core gross margin of the business increased pretty substantially year-over-year. So I’m curious, can you maybe comment on what’s driving that strong expansion within the core business ex float?"}
{"doc_type": "earnings_call", "ticker": "PCTY", "period": "2023_Q1", "date": "2022-11-05", "section": "qa", "speaker": "Ryan Glenn", "text": "Sure. So I think, obviously, really happy with the increase in margin in the quarter, I think, about 160 basis points, including the impact of interest income and, to your point, some really nice leverage, even actual interest income. And I think for us, that is continued focus on scaling the business and driving leverage and efficiencies, automation in those teams, and we continue to drive against that game plan. So I think as we step back and look at the quarter’s results from a profitability standpoint, felt like we executed against our game plan of leverage in margin and G&A, and you saw the incremental investment in growth driving areas of business that primarily being sales and marketing and R&D."}

I wanted to dig into the strong sales force execution. You really seem to have kind of reached another level here. So what do you attribute the notable step-up in this execution that you’re seeing?"}
{"doc_type": "earnings_call", "ticker": "PCTY", "period": "2023_Q1", "date": "2022-11-05", "section": "qa", "speaker": "Steve Beauchamp", "text": "Yes. So I think it probably put it into two different categories. I think first and foremost, the product is really resonating in the marketplace. If you think of the challenges of today, being able to find, attract the people that you’re looking for, being able to retain them, it is still a challenging labor market. And so when you have tools that don’t just automate your processes but actually allow you to engage and drive a different culture and really create the right environment for collaboration, clients are seeing real value in that equation. And so I think it’s really helping us win from a product perspective. That’s number one. I think number two, the sales team is really executing on all cylinders. And so that’s getting people hired and trained and making sure that they take that value proposition and can tell the story and create differentiation. And so it’s really a combination of having a great story to tell and having a sales force that is firing on all cylinders, as you mentioned."}
{"doc_type": "earnings_call", "ticker": "PCTY", "period": "2023_Q1", "date": "2022-11-05", "section": "qa", "speaker": "Bryan Bergin", "text": "Okay. And then just, I guess, where do you stand now in the penetration of some of the newer products, so Community Plus, Premium Video? Just into your total client base today, where have penetration levels gotten to?"}
{"doc_type": "earnings_call", "ticker": "PCTY", "period": "2023_Q1", "date": "2022-11-05", "section": "qa", "speaker": "Steve Beauchamp", "text": "I think the way we like to think about that is if you take the total amount of product that we can sell, meaning if a customer bought everything, and you do the math based off of roughly our average client size, which we give you directionally, and you look at the total number of clients, you’re going to get to a number that’s, call it, approaching 60%, up to two-thirds in that kind of range of all available product that we can sell to our clients. And so we’re going to continue to add new product on top of that. And so we think there’s still a fair amount of runway to take that higher and sell exactly products that are newer, Surveys, Premium Video, Community Plus, and still get penetration into some of the products we’ve had for a while that can still go higher. So our inside sales team is an area that we’ve invested in for several years now, and we continue to invest that at even a faster rate than the rest of our sales force. We still get most of our revenue from new customers, but that will continue to become a more meaningful part of our growth equation."}

At Elevate, you had 4,000 prospects and existing clients, how many were prospects? And what was the element that ended up gaining the most attention that you’re most excited about with regards to prospects? And then what are you most excited about in terms of selling into the existing base right now that where they were really focused?"}
{"doc_type": "earnings_call", "ticker": "PCTY", "period": "2023_Q1", "date": "2022-11-05", "section": "qa", "speaker": "Steve Beauchamp", "text": "Sure. So I think on your first question, we definitely cater that event towards current clients. There is a lot of content for current clients, both in terms of industry trends, what’s happening and then, of course, how to use our product to better manage their HR teams, create more engagement, culture. That’s really the idea, of really trying to connect that across all of the challenges that they might have in the business. We typically see less than 10% of the attendees would be prospects. It’s the kind of way to think about it. It’s usually people that are in the evaluation cycle and near the tail end and can see some value in that agenda. And we get a lot of newer customers that attend as well. So it was a great event for us. Virtually, we’ve been able to host even more people than we’ve been able to do in person and super successful. I think you had a second part to that question, too."}

Of the existing clients, what are the modules that were gaining the most attention in terms of being added on? And how are you thinking about that in this key selling season? About going to, you said you increased your inside sales force. What are they most excited about selling?"}
{"doc_type": "earnings_call", "ticker": "PCTY", "period": "2023_Q1", "date": "2022-11-05", "section": "qa", "speaker": "Steve Beauchamp", "text": "Yes. So I would say we’re definitely seeing increased product penetration rate across the entire portfolio. So it is not really being outstripped by just one or two different modules. But as you might imagine, some of the things that are newer are things that our customers might not necessarily knew we had. We’re definitely seeing things like video with higher penetration. The need to collect more feedback from our customers and our Survey product has also seen a nice uptick. Recruiting has been strong really for a while now. It’s obviously been a tough labor market. So that product gets even more important. But even things like onboarding and automating that, smaller clients are even seeing value in that whereas, when we released that three or four years ago, it was definitely towards the upper end of the market. So it’s pretty across the board. And one of the challenges that you find is when you’ve got 30,000-plus customers, you’ve got to keep them educated and knowledgeable of all the new things that you’re creating, and Elevate becomes a good opportunity to do that."}

And then you acquired Blue Marble back in September of last year. How much did that end up contributing in the quarter? And what was the organic growth rate this quarter?

So as we talked about at the timing of the acquisition, the Blue Marble impact was less than 2% of revenue. So that was the impact on a full year basis. Obviously, this quarter, we had a full quarter impact of Blue Marble, whereas last year, it was just the one month. So that was incrementally helpful, but it’s in the one to two point range. And then from a macro standpoint, we did see some positive growth in workforce levels, as Toby had called out. And we haven’t called out exactly what that specifically was, but it was somewhere into the mid-single digits year-over-year, where that number has trended versus last year. So incrementally helpful, but it has leveled off."}

Yes, I mean, I think we talked in the prepared remarks about that being comprised of investments in people, in marketing and product. And I think that’s pretty consistent with past situations where we’ve had a rising rate environment and decisions to invest back into the business to drive future growth. So I think consistent strategy, consistent deployment from an investment perspective there, and I think it is across all those areas. In some sense, it’s continuing to hire to support the growth of the business. Obviously, great quarter, and we’re pretty bullish on the year, and so it will be continuing to invest throughout the course of the year to support the growth of the business. Certainly, we’ve talked previously about incremental investments in product and I think we have a long history of putting dollars back into our product teams and driving incremental PPI over the course of time. And then I think we’ve also talked about incremental investments in things like digital lead gen from a marketing perspective. And I think those are all of the types of things that we would look to deploy incremental dollars into as we look at the balance of this fiscal year."}

So I think there’s some timing elements within the quarter, for sure. We have expanded our restricted stock program to a broader array of our employee base. I think you’ll see that normalize a bit as the year goes on. Last year, I think SBC was about 12% of revenue. It may tick up slightly this year but not change materially. And I think as we look at some of the other elements around equity compensation, whether that is burn rate or overhang, I feel really good about where those fall versus our broader peer set. So you may see a slight tick-up with that expanded program, but beyond that, nothing I’d call out."}

I just wanted to ask, have you assumed the worsening of the macro environment in your guidance?

And how much of the raise in FY 2023 revenue guidance assumed for the increase in full revenue? And I also wanted to ask, as you move upmarket, what competitors are you running into?

I’m going to do my best. But I think the first question was related to what we assumed in guidance from a macro standpoint. And I think consistent with how we’ve treated it historically, we’ve guided to what has been in front of us. So to Toby’s comments in the prepared remarks, we did see a bit of growth between July and October, although it certainly normalized from the increase we saw prior to that. So we took that into account. We did not assume a degradation going forward. And I think the way that I would characterize that is it would take a pretty significant downturn from a macro standpoint to materially impact our revenue results. I actually feel really good about the momentum with what our sales team has headed into selling season. We feel really good about where we are from a retention standpoint. So certainly something that we are watching closely. But feel like, as we watch that, there’s nothing that I would call out as a near-term risk, although it’s certainly something that we’re watching closely. Maybe if you can repeat the next part of the question."}

I think maybe hitting the macro point first. I mean, I think our perspective historically has been that we will continue to lean into sales and marketing investments and investments in products, which was your question. And I think that certainly is the case this year. We’re looking to deploy some incremental dollars there. And I think even in the face of macro downturn, as we saw in the course of the pandemic, we still look to invest in those areas. Those are really the growth-driving areas of the business. And on a longer-term basis, those are important investments for us. And then in terms of the competitive environment, we’ve announced over the course of the last year or so, a slight push upmarket, which is really driven by our clients and prospects taking us there. It’s been a growing part of our business. And I think the competitive environment there, I don’t see it changing. Going back to Steve’s comments earlier, I haven’t seen any great shift in that over the last six months or so. So..."}

I was wondering if you could talk about how Blue Marble is performing. Are you seeing it help you win new clients? Or are you cross-selling much into your existing base?

{"doc_type": "earnings_call", "ticker": "PCTY", "period": "2023_Q1", "date": "2022-11-05", "section": "qa", "speaker": "Steve Beauchamp", "text": "Sure. So if you go back to the original thesis, part of the idea of bringing Blue Marble onto our platform was the idea that people would be more open to working globally as remote work started to increase in popularity. And so what we see is clients that are predominantly in the U.S. are, on an increasing rate, have employees in different countries. And so that’s where Blue Marble really enters the equation because you can get them paid through Blue Marble software and the partners that we’ve got around the world that help us get that done. So we definitely have felt like that’s been a nice differentiation for those customers that have employees outside of the U.S. We’re pretty integrated from a go-to-market perspective. A lot of our operation teams are continuing down that integration path. Product obviously, naturally takes a little bit longer because you’ve got different platforms you’re kind of connecting. It’s a fairly seamless experience for customers today, but there’s a lot we think we can still do to enhance that experience. And I still believe that over time, customers will have more and more employees internationally. So we’re very happy with the performance so far. I think there’s actually still a lot of opportunity in front of us, though."}

{"doc_type": "earnings_call", "ticker": "PCTY", "period": "2023_Q1", "date": "2022-11-05", "section": "qa", "speaker": "Steve Beauchamp", "text": "Yes. So I think the impact on inflation as much as it has a macroeconomic impact and potentially has an impact in terms of number of employees our clients will have, so if we hit a recession, in historical recessions, you’ve seen client’s not necessarily adding employees but maybe they’ve got fewer employees. And so that, because we get paid on a per employee per month basis, that directly impacts our revenue. You can obviously trace back to the pandemic, and that happened precipitously and then recovered, it would be much lower based off historical recessions. But that would be impact number one. On the flip side, when you’re in a high inflation environment, you obviously know that the Fed tries to get inflation down by raising interest rates. And so we benefit from interest rates, which ends up being a bit of a hedge to the first impact. And the last thing I would say is people have to be able to still have employees. They have to be able to get payroll done. They’ve got HR processes that are must-do items, and they want them to be more efficient. So from a selling motion perspective, we’ve been pretty successful in prior recession environments, being able to kind of grow through that and still make sure that our value proposition is important to customers."}

Beauchamp", "text": "Thanks, Ryan, and thanks to all of you for joining us on our fourth quarter and fiscal '25 earnings call. Our differentiated value proposition of providing the most modern platform in the industry continues to resonate in the marketplace and helped drive recurring revenue growth of 14% and total revenue growth of 12% in Q4. For fiscal '25, recurring revenue growth grew 15% and total revenue grew 14% as we ended the year with $1.6 billion of revenue. Our sustained multiyear investment in R&D has resulted in continued product differentiation and a significant expansion of our product suite, which has helped drive durable recurring revenue growth and continued expansion of our average revenue per client. Most recently, we announced the launch of Paylocity for Finance, expanding our market-leading modern workforce platform for HCM into the office of the CFO and bringing both finance and HR together through a unified system grounded in the employee record. With the addition of Airbase and our previously launched headcount planning solution, Paylocity for Finance delivers a comprehensive suite of tools that connects day-to-day spend management with strategic workforce planning, reflecting our vision to equip leaders with modern AI-powered solutions that bridge the gap between HR and finance on our single unified platform. Going forward, our clients can now manage both payroll and non-payroll spend in a single platform and eliminate disconnected systems, manual processes and approval bottlenecks. Product expansion has been a key part of Paylocity's growth algorithm for over a decade, and we believe Paylocity for Finance, together with the continued expansion of our HCM portfolio, will drive further growth over time in our average revenue per client, which reached just over $35,300 in fiscal '25 compared to $32,800 in fiscal '24, an increase of approximately 8%. We believe Paylocity for Finance represents a significant multiyear opportunity for both new clients and to cross sell back into our 41,650 existing client base, which grew 7% from fiscal '24. Our commitment to product development also continues to be recognized in the market, with Paylocity recently winning a TrustRadius top-rated award in HR management software for the third year in a row. I would now like to pass the call to Toby to provide further color on the quarter."}

In Q4 and fiscal '25, our differentiated position in the market was reflected in solid sales execution, and we have continued investing in our go-to-market functions to carry this momentum into fiscal '26 across sales, marketing and channel referrals. Coming into fiscal '26, we expanded our sales force by 8% to 952 sales reps, and we'll be focused on continuing to drive productivity and efficiency across our teams. Consistent with prior years, we are pleased to be fully staffed to begin fiscal '26, and we continue to successfully attract the best sales talent in the industry, positioning us well for durable recurring revenue growth. We also saw another strong year of channel performance, primarily from benefit brokers who once again represented more than 25% of new business in fiscal '25. The sustained success of our broker channel continues to be driven by our modern platform, third-party integration and API capabilities and because we do not compete against our broker partners by selling insurance products. We remain committed to investing in and supporting the broker channel with the goal of continuing to deliver real value and true partnership in support of our referring brokers and their clients. Revenue retention also remained consistent at greater than 92% in fiscal '25, and we remain committed to investing in our operations teams to deliver world-class service to our clients. As Steve highlighted, we are excited about the opportunity with the recent launch of Paylocity for Finance, which represents the natural evolution of our mission to simplify work through innovation and empowers finance teams with AI-powered automated solutions seamlessly integrated into the Paylocity platform, including headcount planning, expense management, AP automation, corporate cards and guided procurement. By unifying data and connecting critical workflows, we're delivering enhanced visibility, improved efficiency and an exceptional user experience that drives increased value across HR and finance teams and their employees. Employees will now be able to submit expense reports and spend requests in the same system they already use for payroll, time tracking and benefits, while managers will benefit from a single centralized task list for all approvals, whether for time off, expenses or purchases. This unified experience minimizes friction, accelerates financial processes, provides better controls and ultimately drives increased value from a single platform. For example, an early adopter has consistently struggled to manage approvals and spend requests across multiple disconnected systems, leading to bottlenecks and delayed decisions, sometimes taking up to 45 days to complete a purchase. After implementing Paylocity for Finance, including AP automation and guided procurement, the client was able to streamline their approval cycle by eliminating numerous manual steps and integrating seamlessly with their existing critical systems, driving greater efficiency and generating time savings for their finance teams. With features like invoice matching, they now have full confidence that incoming invoices align with preapproved spend, ensuring every purchase is backed by clear accountability and real-time visibility. Our strong culture, industry-leading software innovation and exceptional sales and operational execution would not be possible without the dedication and commitment of our employees. As we close out a very strong fiscal '25, I'd like to thank all of our people and teams for a fantastic year. The strong culture at Paylocity also continues to be recognized externally as we recently were named by Newsweek as one of America's Greatest Workplaces for Gen Z, listed by Time as one of America's Best Midsized Companies and included in the Association for Talent Development's 2025 Best Award Winners list. I would now like to pass the call to Ryan to review the financial results in greater detail and provide an initial outlook on fiscal '26."}
{"doc_type": "earnings_call", "ticker": "PCTY", "period": "2025_Q4", "date": "2025-08-06", "section": "qa", "speaker": "Ryan Glenn", "text": "Thanks, Toby. Recurring revenue for the fourth quarter was $369.9 million, an increase of 14%, with total revenue up 12% from the same period last year. As Toby noted, our sales team had another solid quarter, and we were pleased to come in $10.2 million above the top end of our revenue guidance, with the majority of our Q4 revenue beat coming from recurring and other revenue. Adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter was $130.7 million or 32.6% margin and exceeded the top end of our guidance by $8 million. For fiscal '25, adjusted EBITDA was $583 million or 36.5% margin and an increase of 15% on a dollar basis from fiscal '24, resulting in leverage of 50 basis points. Excluding the impact of interest income on funds held for clients, adjusted EBITDA margin for fiscal '25 was 31.2%, reflecting operating leverage of 120 basis points versus fiscal '24 and approximately 220 basis points of organic operating leverage when excluding the impact of Airbase. Additionally, we continue to show strong growth on free cash flow with fiscal '25 free cash flow margin of 21.5%, representing an increase of 12% on a dollar basis from fiscal '24 despite facing material headwinds as we transition to full cash taxpayer status, the impact of lower interest rates and the headwinds from the Airbase acquisition. Excluding the impact of interest income on client-held funds, we expanded free cash flow by approximately 19% in fiscal '25, representing margin expansion of 50 basis points. We continue to have confidence in our ability to further expand free cash flow on a go-forward basis. We continue to make significant investments in research and development. And to understand our overall investment in R&D, it is important to combine both what we expense and what we capitalize. On a combined non-GAAP basis, total R&D investments were 14.3% of revenue in fiscal '25. And on a dollar basis, our year-over-year investment in total R&D increased by 14% when compared to fiscal '24. We continue to believe our investments in R&D provide us with valuable product differentiation and the ability to drive future growth as we deliver the most modern platform in the industry. On a non-GAAP basis, sales and marketing expenses were 23.1% of revenue in the fourth quarter and 21% of revenue in fiscal '25. On a non-GAAP basis, G&A costs were 9.7% of revenue in the fourth quarter. And on a full year basis, G&A costs were 9.3% of revenue, and we remain focused on continuing to drive leverage in our G&A expenses on an annual basis. Briefly covering our GAAP results. For Q4, gross profit was $271.9 million, operating income was $66.2 million and net income was $48.6 million. For the full year, gross profit was $1.1 billion, operating income was $304 million and net income was $227.1 million. In regard to funds held for clients and interest income, our average daily balance of client funds was $3.1 billion in Q4 and $3 billion for fiscal '25. We are estimating the average daily balance will be approximately $2.85 billion in Q1 of fiscal '26 with an average annual yield of approximately 390 basis points, representing approximately $27.5 million of interest income in Q1. On a full year basis, we are estimating the average daily balance will be $3.15 billion in fiscal '26 with an average yield of approximately 350 basis points, representing approximately $110 million of interest income. In regard to interest rates, our guidance assumes 4 25 basis point rate cuts during fiscal '26 with a cut in September, December, March and April reflected in our guidance. Additionally, given the confidence we have in our business and our strong cash flows, we repurchased approximately 315,000 shares of common stock at an average price of $178.21 per share for $56 million in aggregate repurchases during Q4. In total for fiscal '25, we repurchased approximately 800,000 shares of common stock at an average price of $190.16 per share for roughly $150 million in aggregate repurchases. In July, our Board increased our share repurchase authorization by an additional $500 million. In addition to the increased authorization, as of June 30, we had approximately $200 million remaining under the existing repurchase program and anticipate continuing to execute against the repurchase program going forward. In fiscal '25, we also drove 140 basis points of leverage in stock-based comp expense and achieved our target of less than 10% of revenue as stock-based comp expense was down year-over-year on a dollar basis for the second consecutive year. In regards to the balance sheet, we ended the fiscal year with $398.1 million in cash, cash equivalents and invested corporate cash and $162.5 million outstanding on our credit facility related to the Airbase acquisition, with approximately $81 million repaid on our outstanding balance in Q4. Finally, I'd like to provide our guidance for Q1 and full fiscal year '26, which includes the impact of 100 basis point interest rate cuts in fiscal '26 and flat workforce levels in fiscal '26 versus fiscal '25. For the first quarter of fiscal '26, recurring and other revenue is expected to be in the range of $370 million to $375 million or approximately 12% growth over first quarter fiscal '25 recurring and other revenue. And total revenue is expected to be in the range of $397.5 million to $402.5 million or approximately 10% growth over first quarter fiscal '25 total revenue. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be in the range of $131 million to $135 million and adjusted EBITDA, excluding interest income on funds held for clients, is expected to be in the range of $103.5 million to $107.5 million. And for fiscal '26, recurring and other revenue is expected to be in the range of $1.597 billion to $1.612 billion or approximately 9% growth over fiscal '25 recurring and other revenue. Total revenue is expected to be in the range of $1.707 billion to $1.722 billion or approximately 8% growth over fiscal '25. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be in the range of $608.5 million to $618.5 million and adjusted EBITDA, excluding interest income on funds held for clients, is expected to be in the range of $498.5 million to $508.5 million, representing approximately 20 basis points of leverage at the midpoint. In conclusion, as we kick off fiscal '26, we remain confident in our differentiated value proposition, go-to-market strategy, operational strength and product road map and believe our predictable business model and execution, durable recurring revenue growth and prudent approach to guidance sets us up for a strong fiscal '26. A combination of industry-leading recurring revenue growth and free cash flow margin, a long track record of strong and consistent revenue retention, expanding both our client base and average revenue per client, we have a high level of confidence in our ability to continue to drive sustainable revenue growth and increase margin on a multiyear basis as we execute against our goal of surpassing $2 billion in total revenue. Operator, we're now ready for questions."}

A couple of them, I don't know who wants to take this between probably Steve and Toby, but how do we think about the demand environment right now? I kind of look at your results and ARPU growth remained really strong in the year. Customer growth is normalizing towards mainly pre-pandemic level, maybe a little bit elevated from that, but a really consistent number right now. Is this how we should view the environment that's kind of baked in your guidance into '26? Are there any puts and takes with the ability to maybe move that customer acquisition kind of number maybe up or down in the year?"}

So I mean, I think relative to the demand environment, I think we saw a fairly stable demand environment across the course of the year, and that's what we continue to see in Q4 as well. And to your comment -- or part of your question, I think we saw relative stability in the year-to-year growth in units through '25 and then the same thing with respect to ARPU with ARPU growth and unit growth being fairly evenly distributed through the course of '25. And so ultimately, with all those things, really happy with the execution from a go-to-market and from a sales team perspective throughout the course of '25, which is where I think you saw some of the overage come from."}

And then, Ryan, if I look at the financials, pretty much in line with my expectations from what we heard in the quarter, but your sales and marketing expense had a kind of a significant jump quarter-over-quarter. Maybe kind of help us understand what the difference there is. I don't know if it's bonus payments or some new investments in some programs here going into this year, but any color there would be helpful."}

Obviously, as Toby mentioned, we came into the year fully staffed as well. So a fair amount of hiring in the fourth quarter as well. So it's really just timing within the year. I would say, as we look at the sales and marketing spend over the course of '25 and headed into '26, we came in consistent with expectations."}

It seems pretty large relative to maybe just adding another module or 2 on the HR side."}
{"doc_type": "earnings_call", "ticker": "PCTY", "period": "2025_Q4", "date": "2025-08-06", "section": "qa", "speaker": "Steven R. Beauchamp", "text": "Sure. I think as we had mentioned after we had made that acquisition that we would anticipate doing the integration in phases. We certainly put out the press release indicating we've completed the first phase of that integration, which is certainly probably the most meaningful step. However, we do view opportunity to continue to integrate that platform over time. And we're excited about that opportunity and getting user feedback and continue to look for the leverage that we believe we can drive from an employee record perspective across HCM and finance. And so product is in market, I would say, a fully integrated version with new opportunities coming, and we'll probably see enhancements to that realistically every quarter is our goal. I think on the second point, with our go-to-market motion, we are just in the process with that product just being released, getting our field sales organization up to speed and knowledgeable with the integrated product offering such that they can refer an inside sales team of experts to then be able to take those opportunities across the finish line. And we've also got that inside sales team of experts looking at back to the base opportunities. And so all that has just been launched with the press release that you saw from an integration perspective."}

I think we've expanded free cash flow margin by, call it, 400 basis points just over the last 2 years and continue to have a lot of confidence that we'll be able to do so in '26 and on a go-forward basis. I think probably the only note I would make is you do have the likelihood of some tailwind relative to the new tax legislation. We're still working through what that impact would look like specifically, but a high likelihood that, that will reduce our federal taxes in fiscal '26, and that will have a knock-on effect or a tailwind to free cash flow. So we'll be able to provide more details as we get more clarity, but that's probably the one item I would note. We're now full cash taxpayer status outside of that new legislation and have a lot of confidence that, that free cash flow margin and EBITDA will continue to move forward in '26 and beyond."}

One, just on Paylocity for Finance. Can you tell us a little bit about -- I know it's extremely early, but what sort of expectations are you kind of building in for that? And can you talk a little bit about the pricing, the types of clients that would probably be the most likely to adopt the experiences of the clients that you've talked to thus far. I remember during our conference, Toby was very optimistic about how things were going there."}
{"doc_type": "earnings_call", "ticker": "PCTY", "period": "2025_Q4", "date": "2025-08-06", "section": "qa", "speaker": "Steven R. Beauchamp", "text": "Yes. So I think early on, we are getting good feedback from customers. They see the value in the integrated platform, the ability to leverage the employee data that we have so that it's easy to request spend, easy to put in rules around spend, make sure that, that approval process happens relatively quickly. All of that leads to a much faster close process on the back end. And so I think the integration is getting us a really good feedback. We're also very pleased with the stand-alone product capabilities that we purchased and our ability to be able to continue to move those forward and enhance those based off client feedback. So I think that has gone pretty well. As you mentioned, we are still early. We are setting up our first clients on the integrated offering kind of as we speak. And so we're excited about that opportunity. But I think what I would say is one of the questions we get a lot of is, how is that sales process going to translate from a decision-maker capability. That's another area that I would say we're pretty happy with. The CFO is definitely involved in a payroll and HR purchase, although sometimes they're not the primary decision-maker, but we have certainly had opportunities, either via referrals or back-to-base conversations, to have pretty easy access into that conversation from a CFO perspective. And they've got appreciation for what the integration offers as well as the opportunity to get a singular support structure as well. And so early on, good success. I would say our expectations are that it takes a little bit longer than maybe an additional module from a sales process because it is a bigger purchase price, as you mentioned. So it might take us a little bit longer to get to the same penetration rates as additional HCM modules, but we feel confident that our over 40,000 customers represent a great opportunity to sell back into."}

So I think over time, we've always talked about modules getting into that 10% to 20% penetration rate. That would still be the goal with this. As I mentioned, it may take a little bit longer. However, the revenue per client is much higher. And so it can certainly be more impactful than most of our HCM modules that we've launched. It will also provide us additional capabilities from an expense management perspective. So we had an expense management solution embedded in our suite. I would call that a more basic version. They have much more advanced capabilities. And so I think that represents an opportunity. That is priced generally on a PEPM basis. And the rest of the modules are really per employee per user."}

I mean I think we are, first of all, really, I think, happy with our ability to get the Airbase deal done, certainly an area of strategic interest for us. And to be able to get the integration accomplished with the success that we have and then the launch just recently of Paylocity for Finance and so I think overall, have been very happy with our ability over time, not just to do that deal, but to do a few others that have been strategic to us that have really added to the product set and helped drive our differentiation over time and drive more value to clients. So I think the strategy around M&A has been fairly consistent and will continue to be in terms of being open to areas where we can accelerate the road map through M&A. I think the focus from our teams generally is to be able to continue to build out products that drive more value for clients and that address key needs. And when we can augment that from an M&A standpoint in areas that will accelerate the product road map, I think those are the things that are interesting to us. But I think it's a fairly high bar from the standpoint of really being focused on the ability to take any acquired product and integrate it so tightly into the platform that a user can't tell whether you built it or bought it. And I think that's what we're doing with Airbase, which is one of the reasons I think we're so excited about the experience that we're creating from that integrated product set."}

That becomes one of the ways that we can drive both a better client experience, but also margin enhancements over time. And so as we continue to identify use cases, make investments and realize the benefits from it, that becomes part of our long- term model and the way that we think about driving efficiency in the business."}

I've created a relationship with the Head of HR as well as the CFO. I realize they could benefit from some of the Airbase modules. I can refer them over to an expert. We can do that all as part of one sales process. We could actually go back to them after they've already started or start them first from a finance perspective. And so the incentives are absolutely there. And as we mentioned earlier, it's fairly robust from an annual recurring revenue, which creates even a higher incentive for our field sales force of over 900 people to be able to refer our team of experts in."}

I mean I think we're still early for sure. But I think there's incremental value that we're delivering to clients from the ability to have a finance solution on the same platform. And that's a different strategy that I think you see with the vast majority of our competitors in the HCM space. So we definitely view it as a point of differentiation. And I think to Steve's earlier comments, yes, we're very early, but I think we're really pleased with what we've been able to do in terms of the integration of the Airbase products and solutions into a single platform that is real value, that is significant value prop for clients, both new clients coming onto our platform and back into the client base. So I think we're optimistic, early days, but optimistic with the traction we'll be able to get with that value prop."}

So I think part of the attraction was this was another horizontally interesting area that we think we can also take into different verticals the same way that we have Paylocity for Payroll and HDN. So I think it's a great fit for the platform. And I think going back to Steve's comments, early days, but I think the early traction that we're seeing is positive. I think we're pretty excited about it."}

On the first part, it's been 10 months since we made the acquisition. And we're just now in the last couple of weeks, launching Paylocity for Finance. And so we're really just now at a point where we have the Airbase products integrated into the Paylocity platform. And so I think we're really at the point now where we can be, I think, more focused and more aggressive from a sales team and from a go-to-market standpoint. Now that we really have, I think, a key part of the value prop, we're able to deliver again a key part of the value prop in terms of the whole set of solutions on a single platform, which is, I think, really important to clients and prospects. So we're in the early days, but I think the feedback so far from a just product perspective has been very strong. That was part of our attraction to the Airbase business was the strength of the product that has been well regarded in things like G2. So I think our view was we could take a really strong product, create significant integration on a single platform and bring that to market and that, that would be valuable to clients. And I think that's what we're seeing, albeit in the early days of launch."}

So I think if you look at module adoption, expense management probably has the greatest adoption. And in some cases, that ends up being the entry product, although we absolutely see full suite purchases because once you have all your employees using that and making approvals, you can then really take advantage of that utilization on that single platform to drive spend management, more complex rules, all the reporting on the back end. And ultimately, if you use all of their products, we've got all the data that they spend both on people as well as on their business items. And so there's analytics on the back end that are valuable to the customers. But if I had to call one out, I think that's probably the expense management in terms of the most penetrated module they offer. Ryan, any comments?"}

I think to your point, Q1 is the fourth quarter of the Airbase impact. And I think you see a little bit of that in the guide. And I think you also see the strong momentum we had to end fiscal '25. If you look at what's implied for Q2 to Q4, I think it's sort of 8% to roughly 8.5% recurring. And I think, as I said in the prepared remarks, guidance approach will likely be similar in fiscal '26, which is to say if we continue to see strong execution, we obviously have closer and better visibility into the near-term quarter, and that's typically where you see probably slightly higher revenue growth in guidance and then a level of prudence as you think about probably the back half of the year. But we feel good about the momentum, feel good about the Q1 and full year guide. And I think if we continue to execute well, hope to be able to take that number up as we go throughout '26, very similar to what we did in '25."}

And I think that continued clearly through the course of '25. And I think what I'd say is our message, I think, has resonated in the market. I think it continues to. I think that continued through the course of '25 and into Q4. And so I think that continues to be strong for us. And I certainly think, to your question, our value prop that we have always stood behind, including not competing with brokers from a market standpoint, is a really important point that we've certainly leaned on and I think has continued to resonate. So I feel good about where we finished in '25 with respect to broker relationships in the broker channel. I think we're teed up for continued momentum there as we go into Q1."}

And I think that's what sits underneath our guide as we've come into Q4, developed the guide and as we look across '26, I think we're making a similar assumption relative to the demand environment. And I think our sales and go-to- market team did a great job of executing throughout the course of '25. And I think that is what allowed us to produce the results that we reported."}

I mean I think coming into fiscal '25, we increased our sales headcount by right around 8%. And the goal coming into '25 was to be able to continue to drive productivity. And I think that's what we saw throughout the course of the year, quarter-to-quarter and then looking back on the full fiscal year. I think we continue to have access to the best talent in the industry from a go-to-market, from a sales perspective. And that's always been the goal to be, I think, the destination in the industry for the best talent. I think that continues to be the case. And I think we're really fortunate we're able to come into fiscal '26 fully staffed again with right around 8% headcount growth again this year coming into '26. And I think looking out across the year, I think the goal and the focus will be exactly the same as it was in '25: to be able to take that 8% headcount lift and to be able to continue to drive productivity. And I think that's exactly what you saw us be able to do throughout the course of '25. So I think pretty happy overall with the setup that we think we have for '26."}

But I think the value prop, you've got people in our kind of mobile app every day using all of our products on the web. And so when we talk to a CFO and present the opportunity to be able to manage expenses, spend, cards, all in a single place with incremental rules that match the organization's policies, and then be able to -- you can lay all that data on the back end for a faster close, it's a pretty interesting value proposition that we find. Most customers are at least willing to entertain the conversation, and then it's about differentiating versus other competitive offerings that they can have. And so overall, I think it really starts with the integrated platform is the point I'm really trying to make and the value that it is from a service and implementation and how easy all that really is to use. And then we've got the finance capabilities that they're looking for with a very rich product in the Airbase capabilities. But as I said, it's probably not going to scale quite as fast as simply an HCM add-on because it's a higher price point. It's probably a bigger commitment from an organizational implementation. But early signs, we feel really good about that. We feel good about the referrals that we've gotten back to the client base as well as new prospects. And we were only a few weeks in, as Toby mentioned, into the launch. So we're going to keep making this better over time and take advantage of the opportunity."}

As other companies have looked to build out their accounts payable products, there's always a lot of focus on the supplier side of the network as much as the customer side.

So certainly managing who the supplier is, there's a PO process that maybe a larger organization might have to be able to make sure that, that purchase is approved with that supplier, obviously, making those payments on the back end. I think the greater the payment volume that you've got, then the greater opportunity is to have that broad supplier network. And so we certainly will see that, I think, opportunity become more interesting as we scale this solution over time and we drive volume through the platform. If you look at the average customer size being roughly similar to ours around 150 employees, you probably, in general, are not necessarily highly sophisticated in terms of that supplier network. But it's an area that we're investing in and that we feel as we scale and drive volume to, will create incremental opportunity."}

Our differentiated value proposition of providing the most modern software in the industry continues to resonate in the marketplace and help drive recurring revenue growth of 15% and total revenue growth of 16% in Q4. For fiscal 2024, recurring revenue grew 17% over fiscal 2023, and total revenue grew 19% and finished at $1.4 billion. Our solid results were once again driven by both adding new clients and employees and increasing average revenue per client. We ended fiscal 2024 with 39,050 clients compared to 36,200 at the end of last fiscal year, an increase of 8%. Additionally, our average number of employees per client increased to over 150 given our continued upmarket success. Average recurring revenue per client was nearly $33,000 in fiscal 2024 compared to just over $30,000 in fiscal 2023, an increase of approximately 8% as a result of increasing product attach rates across our client base. We continue to attach more product at the time of sale and have realized increased success selling back into existing clients as our products, focused on the modern workforce, resonate across our entire client base with Learning Management, Recognition & Rewards and Employee Voice seeing particular success. Our sustained investment in product development allows us to continue to expand our product suite, evidenced by the release of several new premium offerings and feature enhancements in fiscal 2024, including Recognition & Rewards, Employee Voice, Advanced Scheduling, Market Pay, AI-driven personalized learning plans and our next-gen mobile app. We are pleased with the early traction of these new product offerings, highlighted by more than 30,000 market job searches within Market Pay, over 500,000 AI-assisted platform interactions and our mobile app ranking is one of the highest in the software industry with the majority of employee interactions on the platform now occurring via mobile. Our commitment to product development continues to be recognized in the market with Paylocity recently being ranked as an overall leader for 10 product categories in G2's Summer 2024 Grid Reports, listed as the Best Payroll and Software combo by Forbes Advisor, named as TrustRadius Top Rated HR Management software platform for the second year in a row and recognized in Gartner Peer Insights 2024 Voice of the Customer for cloud HCM suites for 1,000-plus employee enterprises.

As Steve highlighted, in fiscal 2024, we continued our investments in R&D to further grow our differentiated value proposition of providing the most modern software in the industry and increased our PEPY by more than 10% with the introduction of new premium products and feature enhancements. And we're excited to continue this trend with the launch of headcount planning later in fiscal 2025. In Q4 and fiscal 2024, our differentiated position was reflected in solid sales execution. And we have continued investing in our go-to-market functions to carry this momentum into fiscal 2025 across sales, marketing and channels. Coming into fiscal 2025, we expanded our sales force by 8% to 885 sales reps and will be focused on continuing to drive productivity and efficiency across our teams. Consistent with prior years, we are pleased to be fully staffed to begin fiscal 2025. We continue to successfully attract the best talent in the industry, and we believe that we are well positioned for the fiscal year. We have also continued to invest in our marketing and channel efforts to support our sales teams throughout fiscal 2025, including the recent release of our new Benefits Decision Support enhancement to help continue driving further differentiation and value to our clients and broker channel, which once again, delivered 25% plus of our new business in Q4 and fiscal 2024. Revenue retention also remained strong at greater than 92%, and we remain committed to continuing to invest in our service and support teams to deliver world-class service to our clients. The strong culture at Paylocity continued to be recognized this fiscal year as we were recently named one of Forbes' Best Employers for Diversity for the third year in a row, received ATD's BEST for Employee Talent Development Award and earned the Great Place to Work certification for the seventh consecutive year. Our strong culture, industry-leading software and exceptional sales and operational execution would not be possible without the dedication and commitment of our over 6,000 employees. As we close out a very strong fiscal 2024, I'd like to thank all of our people and teams for a fantastic year.

For fiscal 2024, adjusted EBITDA was $505.6 million or 36% margin, and an increase of 35% on a dollar basis from fiscal 2023, resulting in leverage of 410 basis points. Excluding the impact of interest income on funds held for clients, adjusted EBITDA margin for fiscal 2024 was 30%, reflecting operating leverage of 280 basis points versus fiscal 2023. Additionally, we continue to show strong progress on free cash flow with fiscal 2024 free cash flow margin of 21.8%, up 340 basis points and an increase of 42% on a dollar basis from fiscal 2023. Excluding the impact of interest income on funds held for clients, we drove 170 basis points of operating free cash flow leverage in fiscal 2024 to 14.4% margin. Given our increased profitability and limited remaining NOLs and credits, we expect to become a full cash taxpayer in fiscal 2025, which will create a free cash flow margin headwind in fiscal 2025. But we remain confident in our ability to continue expanding free cash flow margin in the coming years. We continue to make significant investments in research and development and to understand our overall investment in R&D, it is important to combine both what we expense and what we capitalize. On a combined non-GAAP basis, total R&D investments were 14.6% of revenue in the fourth quarter and on a full year basis, total R&D investments were 14.2% of revenue. On a dollar basis, our year-over-year investment in total R&D increased by 18% in fiscal 2024 when compared to fiscal 2023. We continue to believe our investments in R&D provide us with valuable product differentiation and the ability to drive future growth as we deliver the most modern platform in the industry. On a non-GAAP basis, sales and marketing expenses were 22.5% of revenue in the fourth quarter and 21.2% of revenue in fiscal 2024. On a non-GAAP basis, G&A costs were 9.6% of revenue in the fourth quarter versus 10.7% in the same period last year. Full year G&A costs were 9.3% of revenue as compared to 11% in fiscal 2023 representing 170 basis points of leverage, and we remain focused on consistently leveraging G&A expenses on an annual basis. Briefly covering our GAAP results. For Q4, gross profit was $240.4 million, operating income was $62.9 million and net income was $48.8 million. For the full year, gross profit was $960.8 million, operating income was $260.1 million and net income was $206.8 million. In regard to funds held for clients and interest income, our average daily balance of client funds was $2.8 billion in Q4 and $2.6 billion for fiscal 2024. We are estimating the average daily balance will be approximately $2.5 billion in Q1 of fiscal 2025 with an average annual yield of approximately 450 basis points, representing approximately $28 million of interest income on client health funds in Q1. On a full year basis, we are estimating the average daily balance will be $2.75 billion in fiscal 2025 with an average yield of approximately 390 basis points, representing approximately $107 million of interest income on funds held for clients. In regards to interest rates, our guidance assumes 425 [ph] basis point rate cuts during fiscal 2025 with the cut assumed in September, November, March and May reflected in guidance. Additionally, given the confidence we have in our business and our strong cash flows, we repurchased approximately 1.1 million shares of common stock at an average price of $142.82 per share for $150 million in aggregate repurchases during Q4. As a reminder, we have $350 million remaining under our share repurchase program. We also closed Q4 with $401.8 million in cash and cash equivalents on our balance sheet. In fiscal 2024, we also drove 200 basis points of leverage in stock-based compensation expense. And in fiscal 2025, we expect to drive continued leverage in stock-based compensation towards our target of less than 10% of revenue and are committed to driving incremental leverage and stock-based comp annually going forward. Finally, I’d like to provide our financial guidance for Q1 and full fiscal 2025, which includes the impact of the 425 basis point interest rate cuts in fiscal 2025, as mentioned earlier, and roughly flat workforce levels in fiscal 2025 versus fiscal 2024. For the first quarter of fiscal 2025, recurring and other revenue is expected to be in the range of $325.5 million to $330.5 million or approximately 12.5% growth over first quarter of fiscal 2024 recurring and other revenue. And total revenue is expected to be in the range of $353.5 million to $358.5 million or approximately 12.1% growth over first quarter fiscal 2024 total revenue. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be in the range of $116.5 million to $120.5 million. In adjusted EBITDA, excluding interest income on funds held for clients is expected to be in the range of $88.5 million to $92.5 million, which represents approximately 60 basis points of leverage over Q1 of fiscal 2024. And for fiscal year 2025, recurring and other revenue is expected to be in the range of $1.405 billion to $1.420 billion or approximately 10.2% growth over fiscal 2024 recurring and other revenue. Total revenue is expected to be in the range of $1.512 billion to $1.527 billion or approximately 8.3% growth over fiscal 2024. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be in the range of $533 million to $543 million. Adjusted EBITDA, excluding interest income on funds held for clients is expected to be in the range of $426 million to $436 million, which represents approximately 50 basis points of leverage over fiscal 2024. Despite the macro headwinds we faced in 2024, we’re pleased to finish the year with 19% total revenue growth, 17% recurring revenue growth and adjusted EBITDA margin of 36% and a rule of 55 overall performance. As we kick off fiscal 2025, we remain confident in our differentiated value proposition, go-to-market strategy, operational strength and product road map, and we have a high level of confidence in our ability to continue driving durable revenue growth and increasing margins as we execute against our multiyear goal of achieving $2 billion in total revenue. I would now like to turn the call over to Steve for final remarks."}

You’ve got certainly some law of large numbers and then growing at this size and scale. Certainly has been impactful. We’ve called out the most recent impact in terms of whether it was employees on the platform or some of the economic headwind we saw in the sales cycle, we see certainly some impact from that. And so I think you get to a bit of a new normal where we still have an opportunity to be a growth company focused on that $2 billion target. And at the same time, we’ve shifted our focus to driving profitability. And so we’re balancing that equation. I think when you put all that together, we’re still pretty excited about the story that we’ve got in front of us and the size of the opportunity."}

So I think this is the stuff that I’m the best at, to be quite honest with you. It gives me an opportunity to focus on that.

And Toby, I hope you have really big broad shoulders. You might need them. Couple of questions for me. Let’s start off with the guidance for the year. The guidance would at least to me imply subscription revenue growth of sub-10% exiting the year. How do we think about kind of breaking that down a little bit between ARPU growth and net new customer adds? Your growth between accounts and customers pretty balanced last year roughly 8% in each of those categories. But we’re going to be in the sub-10% category, how do we think about what that kind of blend looks like?"}
{"doc_type": "earnings_call", "ticker": "PCTY", "period": "2024_Q4", "date": "2024-08-01", "section": "qa", "speaker": "Toby Williams", "text": "Hey Scott. I mean, I think you saw a pretty balanced performance this last year, and I think that came from the result of executing pretty well from a go-to-market perspective, driving, I think, a ton of new products to market over the course of the last, call it, 1.5 years or so and having success with those products, both in terms of attached to new deals and then being able to sell back into the customer base. And I think ultimately, then we also had strong execution from an operations perspective and providing service to our clients. So I think had a pretty balanced year. As you know, those numbers in the mix has pushed around in prior years a little bit. And I think as we jump into fiscal 2025 we’re really pressing on all the same things, driving strong go-to-market execution, continuing to drive from a product execution and from an attach and penetration perspective and then ultimately, same thing from an ops standpoint, delivering world-class service to our clients. So yes, I think it has changed. The mix is different in every single year. I think we’re happy with the result from a balance perspective in fiscal 2024. And I think as we jump into 2025, it’s continuing to drive on those three things and probably expect that to be you don’t know exactly where it’s going to land throughout the course of the year, but probably expect a relative level of balance in those different factors."}

And then, Toby, I think you noted that your sales capacity is up 8% year-over-year going in this year, you’re fully staffed for the busy selling season. But how do we think about your investments here going forward through the balance of your fiscal year here? What have you contemplated for capacity growth into next spring? And then how flexible are those plans assuming that the macro might potentially change both one way or the other?"}
{"doc_type": "earnings_call", "ticker": "PCTY", "period": "2024_Q4", "date": "2024-08-01", "section": "qa", "speaker": "Toby Williams", "text": "Yes. I think we’ve maintained a fair amount of flexibility as we go through the course of fiscal 2025. And I think that’s been – that’s certainly been our thinking and what we’ve said over the last couple of quarters. And I think the recognition coming into 2025 was that we want to be rightsized for the opportunity in front of us in terms of go-to-market capacity. And as Steve said, I think we feel really good about the opportunity out there in the market. coming in with 8% year-over-year growth in reps, I think, allows us to press on the productivity levers as well as we’ve launched a lot of new products. We feel really good about the go-to-market motion. And I think coming in fully staffed with the ability to attract, I think, the best sales and go-to-market talent in the industry, I think we feel really good about how we’re positioned coming into the year. And if we get an uplift in terms of what the macro looks like. I think we have the flexibility that would allow us to even move that up from where we’re starting and coming into the fiscal year."}

I’m wondering with regards to the comments on the back-to-base motion, can you tell us how big the internal sales group is in terms of that back-to-base motion? And how much when we take a look at the bookings over the course of this year, how much was from new logos versus upsells into the existing base? And how do you think that could trend?"}
{"doc_type": "earnings_call", "ticker": "PCTY", "period": "2024_Q4", "date": "2024-08-01", "section": "qa", "speaker": "Toby Williams", "text": "Yes. I mean maybe just start with a little bit of the history. I think if you go back to our back-to-base motion really would have started in earnest coming off of ACA and that was coming out of, I think, 2016 general time frame wise. And I think that was really the start of that motion and being able to go after that opportunity for us. I think we’ve continued to invest in that more so every single year. And part of that is, as we’ve grown the client base. Part of that is we’ve also grown the product set that we have available to sell back into the base and deliver incremental value to our existing clients. And I think that’s been the direction of it over the last handful plus of years. And in most years, we’ve invested the headcount growth in that team has been higher than the overall coming off a smaller base than and bigger one now. But that’s been the investment philosophy. I think it’s paid off really well for us, both in terms of being able to drive incremental product attachment penetration and incremental revenue growth. But it’s still smaller on a relative basis to our focus on going after new logos and new business in the market. And I think that’s – but as we come into 2025 and even as we look forward, I think our philosophy around investing there would remain true and constant in terms of continuing to deploy dollars there. And ultimately, it’s about being able to bring back solutions to our customers who might not have bought those products or those solutions at the outset of their partnership with us and being able to just keep providing more and more value to our client base."}

And again, ultimately, just being able to deliver incremental value year in and year out to our client base."}

And then can you just comment with regards to – you mentioned success in terms of engagement tools, LMS is getting good upsell. On some of the upsells, obviously, some of them you’re pioneering and they didn’t exist before. Not broadly available. But things like LMS, which have been around, are you displacing other players or some of your clients is basically saying, hey, this sounds like a great tool that we haven’t used before."}

I think as we think about our new product strategy, you can kind of fit it into a couple of buckets. So one ends up being kind of an innovation in the market where we’re often first to market, and we’re able to sell that as a new module and then the second category probably refers to kind of LMS or even think about that as scheduling plus where we have an existing offering, and we’ve enhanced it to a point where there’s additional capabilities that we think we can monetize and bundle. And so LMS was a new bundle that we had with additional content that was available from a compliance perspective for customers that they saw value in. So we have the opportunity there to sell that to new customers as they come on board, but we also have the opportunity to go back to customers. And so as we think about the product opportunity going forward, we look for both of those opportunities. How do we add more value by taking our products to the next level and coming up with new bundles and packages that offer them value and then how do we come up with new and innovative ideas that allow us to continue to be the most modern platform in the industry."}

Was that closer to us and more visible and taking a sort of prudent and measured approach as we think about the balance of the fiscal year. I think with some strong execution, we feel really good about this plan and certainly feel good about the momentum across both product and operations and sales as well."}

I think Toby made the call out as well that we’ve been pretty happy getting fully staffed. And I would say we had very low turnover, certainly when you think of the performing category this year. So not only were we fully staffed, but we came in with a really strong team that we were able to retain going into the year. I think that really speaks to the position that we have in the marketplace. The reps often want to be able to sell the best product in the marketplace. And so we feel good about that. We continue to hire mostly with industry experience. So that would be another point I would make. We’re able to bring on talent. Sometimes it comes from a competitor, sometimes they’ve got prior experience in the industry, but we definitely feel like those folks can ramp faster. And so that is another element of our strategy in terms of building the sales force. And so all three of those elements were clicking going into this fiscal year."}

And we are certainly making some changes in that part of the sales force just to be able to drive efficiency. So we feel like going into the start of this fiscal year, we’ve been able to continue to see strong top-of-funnel activity. We’ve been able to drive, I think, a better sales process and a more efficient sales process. The reality is those larger clients take longer to implement and start. And so I think we called out last quarter that you start to see the success of that on the back half of that year. You get a fair number of starts in January. So we’re off to a good start. We feel good about the plan that we’ve got in front of us, and the activity levels are strong."}

We’ve been pretty happy with the activity levels and kind of our core marketplace. So think about that as kind of under 500 employees. That’s where we have the bulk of our sales force, where we’ve been in a long time. We get a lot of our broker referrals coming in that marketplace. And so kind of the similar comments going in really well staffed. I feel really good about the staffing levels. Ryan just called out, certainly, sales was one of the reasons we beat in fourth quarter. So coming into this year with a fair amount of momentum. And the top of funnel comments would be the same. We’re seeing good top of funnel activity in the upmarket space as well as our core."}

I think we obviously reset or increased our margin targets on this call last year. And as I referenced in my prepared remarks, have made significant progress, not only this year, but over the last few years, well into the profitability levels that we have today. Certainly, there’s a potential headwind there. If you look at the guidance for 2025, we have four rate cuts assumed, so pretty aggressive rate cut activity over the next 12 months. I think the way that we would think about it is you’re seeing us continue to drive leverage ex flow, right? We’ve called out what the guidance looks like outside of interest rates, we’re guiding to, call it, 50 to 60 basis points of leverage this fiscal year. So obviously, that may be a headwind over time. But I think from an operational standpoint, we expect to be able to continue to drive leverage both within adjusted EBITDA as well as free cash flow."}

We’re seeing the same competitors in the market. It’s always been a pretty competitive environment. You’re typically competing with two or three different other competitors as the customer is evaluating that, that dynamic has not changed. As certainly the law of large numbers, not just with us is with the competitive set as well. So we’ve all gotten bigger. And so that is definitely a factor. But when we look at the size of the opportunity relative to our size today, we still feel pretty comfortable that we can not only execute on the plan in front of us this fiscal year, but we can really set our sights on $2 billion and beyond."}

Yes, I think we feel Q4 and then fiscal 2024, another year of driving 25%-plus of our new business coming through our referrals from our partners. And I think have a high degree of confidence in our ability to continue to execute that play as we go through fiscal 2025.

We've grown that upmarket team pretty aggressively. We've had great success over the last several years. It certainly was a little bit of a headwind into this year. But as we go into next year, we feel very well positioned with that team. That's the one that we called out before that we focused on, and that's the one that we spent more time and attention on.

Maybe one on sort of headcount planning that's coming up this year. As you think about a solution like that, it feels like it could be used in use cases beyond just in the HR suite. And so as you start thinking about your roadmap and the opportunity to expand wallet share within your customers, how are you thinking about selling into potentially different persona in the organization, if at all?"}
{"doc_type": "earnings_call", "ticker": "PCTY", "period": "2024_Q4", "date": "2024-08-01", "section": "qa", "speaker": "Steve Beauchamp", "text": "Yes. It's a great question. I think one of the real values that we offer our customers is just the way we give them a platform to manage all their employee data. And when you've got all the employees continually logging into the platform, logging on to our mobile app and using the platform for things like workflows and approvals, it really does start to open up different opportunities. As we – you think we've been first to market on so many different products, you think of video as part of the platform, that probably wasn't something I would have imagined 10 years ago. So we're really starting to look at how do we leverage that employee data that we have to be able to really help our clients offer more value. Headcount planning has a natural tie to HR as position gets replaced, where a new position gets added, there's approvals, there's workflows. You've got to then tie it into your recruiting platform, then it gets tied into onboarding. So we're going to continue to maybe push the boundaries of what might have been a traditional HCM by leveraging that data set. And we're very excited. The CFOs, the persona that we'd be selling headcount planning to largely, they're very much involved in the sale already today. So I wouldn't call that out as a new persona. They probably become more of the primary buyer than maybe the decision-maker today. But our teams are really used to dealing with that persona. They have a lot of interaction with the CFOs today. So that part is probably an easier part of the equation for us."}

{"doc_type": "earnings_call", "ticker": "PCTY", "period": "2024_Q4", "date": "2024-08-01", "section": "qa", "speaker": "Ryan Glenn", "text": "So not in the prepared remarks, Dan, but I think the way to think about that is there's sort of a two-step process for us to becoming a full cash taxpayer. And you saw it step one this year and you look – if you look on the cash flows at the supplemental disclosure, you see we paid roughly $50 million of cash taxes this year versus just a few million dollars a year prior. So that is a headwind that we faced this year. Obviously, you saw significant increases in overall profitability, working capital improvement. So we grew through that, and we continue to leverage free cash flow. Next year, we'll have a similar step up. So you may be looking at $100 million on the round of cash paid for taxes. So that was the call out. Next year, we would become a full cash taxpayer, continue to have a lot of confidence in our ability to drive free cash flow leverage going forward. But that will be a headwind in this 12-month period that we'll be fighting through. Ex float, we'd still expect to be able to drive at least flat free cash flow margins, but did want to call that out as we are entering sort of inflection point there on the cash tax side."}

And it's hard for us to know what's going to happen from a macro perspective in terms of AI driving efficiency in the overall workforce. As Ryan said, this last quarter, we actually saw things stabilized pretty well. So workforce levels were better last quarter than a little better than what we would have expected and pretty stable on a sequential basis. So no early signs that, that is kind of happening in the workforce today. And yes, I think one of the things you got to remember is just a significant part of that workforce that are in industries, that will take a much longer time to be impacted from an AI perspective. And I think lots of organizations might be hiring a little bit less trying to drive efficiencies in this type of macro market. That's been evidenced by workforce levels over the last 15 months. But when we talk to our customers, and we have interactions with them, we don't really hear AI as being the primary driver of that."}

So now you've obviously got us at $1.4 billion, you've got Paycom a little larger than that, ADP, Paychex, UKG, all still grow. And so yes, I think there is some element of the law of large numbers. And it's always – like I said, it's always been kind of a competitive environment. I think you've had a macro that's been kind of uncertain overlaid on top of that. So we are not out there saying, hey, this is – we think we can grow this business at 30% per year. We're talking about, can we continue to grow this business double-digits on a recurring revenue basis? At the same time, can we drive profitability and margin? Because I think that's also a factor. You're trying to balance the equation. And so if you put all that together, and we think we can have kind of a great business. We outlined what those targets will look like last year. We've made great progress over this past year to be able to get there. And we feel good about our starting point and kind of focus on beating and raising from there if we can execute."}

So as you remember, last quarter, we announced a $500 million share repurchase program. We repurchased $150 million of stock this past quarter. So we have $350 million remaining under that program. There's no formal expiration date. So that's something that will be available to us for the foreseeable future. So that continues to be something that we will look at closely in fiscal 2025. I think for us, we have the ability to really drive a number of different priorities from a capital allocation standpoint. So having done $150 million of repurchase in the fourth quarter, we still have $400 million of cash on balance sheet. We have access to a significant amount of cash within our credit facility, and we have increasing cash flow. So we will continue to look at sort of all aspects of capital allocation. Obviously, we've had a handful of acquisitions over the last few years, we're certainly active looking. Bar is high for us, but we're looking at things that may be strategic as well. So I feel like we're in a great position and sort of all things are on the table because of where we are from a financial standpoint."}

I think, as we've called out, we have largely been focused on really landing new customers and selling them more product. And so when you've got 8% client growth, and you're selling those customers more product, that is a big contributor, that average revenue per customer. I think when you go back four years when it was higher, then we had much higher client growth. So that's one aspect. And then on top of that, we've called out the fact that we've been able to sell back to the client base pretty effectively. And so you put that together, and that's what gives us the 8% average revenue per customer growth."}

So that likely showed up in that year-over-year growth in recurring revenue. So you've got some elevated numbers in the fiscal 2022 and 2023 period that probably, when you start to normalize it, would make those numbers look more consistent with what you would have seen last year."}

Now looking at the client growth also, it assumes – I think your guidance assumes that for the resource and client growth, so what sort of trends are you seeing among customers switching their payroll vendors?

I think you're trying to get at the same question of what does the growth model look like on a go-forward basis for this business. We're at $1.4 billion in revenue, and we feel like we can continue to grow this business on a recurring revenue basis double-digits. I think that's what we're talking about doing. And at the same time, we can increase profitability. The size of the opportunity is big enough. As you mentioned, everybody has to get paid some way. So the payroll component of it is often displacement. We then try to add additional products beyond that. And so we feel like we're approaching this with a growth priority, but a fairly balanced view on profitability going forward, and we think there's still a really big TAM for us to attack."}

So the delta there is going to be the interest income expectations. And then we gave adjusted EBITDA as well as adjusted EBITDA ex interest income on client-held funds. So you're able to see all the puts and takes. So I think if you look at those pieces, we're guiding to about 50 basis points of adjusted EBITDA leverage ex-float. When you include the impact of the four rate cuts assumed in the guide, you do see adjusted EBITDA margins going backwards a touch because of those four rate cuts embedded in the guide."}

The market for us is over 1 million customers. And yes, so in any given year, there's a fair number of customers that would consider change. Sometimes you can convince a customer to change when they were not considering a change. So I'm not sure that's completely formulaic. And then there are cycles, whether they're economic cycles, we've also seen compliance cycles, where certain laws and rules come in place that create more of a burden for customers. So there can be some cyclical nature to what happens. And then, of course, macro. Maybe I'm less inclined when the macro environment is a little bit tougher. But still, a lot of customers go through change there. So yes, I think that's absolutely the case. I think we've called out over the last 12 months, it has been from a macro perspective, a little bit of a tougher environment, taking people a little bit longer to make decisions. We've called out this quarter and last quarter that top-of-funnel activity has been pretty good. And we obviously had a pretty nice beat this last quarter.

Our overall momentum continued in third quarter with solid execution across our target market. Q3 revenue growth was 38.2% as our differentiated value proposition of providing the most modern software in the industry continues to resonate in the marketplace. We continue to build on our unique value proposition of providing the most modern software in the industry with the recent release of AI Assist, the HCM industry's first integration of generative AI. Leveraging an integration with OpenAI, the developer of ChatGPT, AI Assist is designed to help our clients more easily and effectively communicate and engage with their employees. Included as a new feature within Community, AI Assist allows users to draft ready-to-send communications and announcements with a simple prompt, tailor messages to specific audiences or even translate announcement into other languages to reach multilingual employees. AI Assist represents the next step in Paylocity's broader investment in AI and machine learning, building upon other AI-based platform capabilities, such as our modern workforce index, retention risk dashboards, time and labor forecast and tone and sentiment analysis in performance reviews. Our commitment to product development also continues to be recognized in the market with Paylocity recently placing number one overall in G2's Best HR Products list and ranking inside of G2's Top 25 Global Software Companies. Additionally, Paylocity was named an overall leader in all 12 human capital management product categories in G2's Spring 2023 Grid Report and won a 2023 Most Loved Award by TrustRadius. Similarly, the strong culture at Paylocity continues to be recognized externally as we received Forbes' 2023 Best Employers for Diversity Award for the second consecutive year. I would now like to pass the call to Toby to provide further color on the quarter."}
{"doc_type": "earnings_call", "ticker": "PCTY", "period": "2023_Q3", "date": "2023-05-04", "section": "qa", "speaker": "Toby Williams", "text": "Thanks, Steve. In Q3, our sales team turned in another solid performance. And as Steve highlighted, our differentiated value proposition of providing the most modern software in the industry continues to resonate across our target market. Our sustained investment in key product areas such as mobile, engagement, AI and analytics continues to strengthen our position as the most modern software platform in the industry and sets us up for a strong close to fiscal 2023. In particular, we've continued to see employees increasingly engage with the platform via mobile and through Community, a trend highlighted across a number of clients in Q3, including a real estate developer with over 400 employees that is leveraging mobile alerts and peer-to-peer recognition to drive and measure higher engagement and connectivity across its geographically dispersed property managers, leasing agents and staff. Similarly, a retailer with 1,300 employees across over 70 locations is leveraging our mobile self-service capabilities, on-demand pay, Community and surveys to drive higher employee engagement and help retain employees. Solid sales and operational execution helped drive our total revenue to $339.9 million or 38.2% growth over Q3 of last year, beating the midpoint of our guidance by $7.4 million as we continue to build momentum across our target market. We also continue to be pleased with the success in go-to-market hiring and attracting talented sales reps, and we are confident in our ability to hit our staffing targets to start next fiscal year. Additionally, channel referrals, primarily from benefit brokers and financial advisers, once again represented more than 25% of new business for the third quarter as we continue to leverage both virtual and in-person broker meetings and events to help us maintain the strong source of referrals. We continue investing to support channel referrals and in digital marketing efforts, both of which have driven increased top-of-sales funnel activity and productivity this fiscal year. Interest income on client funds has also continued to rise as a result of sustained interest rate increases from the Federal Reserve and increases in average daily balances. Our top line outperformance, coupled with continued operational efficiency, helped drive adjusted EBITDA of $130.7 million or 38.4% margin, which exceeded the midpoint of our guidance by $7.7 million. Lastly, Q3 represents our busiest time of year as we work to support our clients through all their year-end processing and annual tax form filing needs. I'd like to send out a big thanks to our more than 6,000 employees, who live and represent our values every single day and who worked so hard to support our clients in Q3. I would now like to pass the call to Ryan to review the financial results in detail and provide updated fiscal 2023 guidance."}

Total revenue for Q3 was $339.9 million, an increase of 38.2% with recurring and other revenues up 28.3% from the same period last year, and we were pleased to come in $7.4 million above the midpoint of our Q3 revenue guidance and to raise fiscal 2022 revenue guidance by $8.5 million at the midpoint, resulting in fiscal 2023 guidance of 37% revenue growth. Our adjusted gross profit was 76.0% for Q3 versus 73.1% in Q3 of last fiscal, representing 290 basis points of leverage as a result of revenue overperformance and continued focus on scaling our operational costs while maintaining industry-leading service levels. We continue to make significant investments in research and development. And to understand our overall investment in R&D is important to combine both what we expense and what we capitalize. On a dollar basis, our year-over-year investment in total R&D increased by 53.5% when compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2022. And we remain focused on making incremental investments in R&D as we continue to build out the Paylocity platform to serve the needs of the modern workforce. In regards to our go-to-market activities, on a non-GAAP basis, sales and marketing expense was 19.1% of revenue in Q3, and we remain focused on making incremental investments in this area of the business to drive growth going forward. On a non-GAAP basis, G&A costs were 10.4% of revenue in the third quarter versus 12.2% in the same period last year, representing 180 basis points of leverage in Q3. Our adjusted EBITDA was $130.7 million or 38.4% of revenue for the quarter, which exceeded our guidance by $7.7 million at the midpoint. And we remain committed to progressing against our adjusted EBITDA target of 30% to 35% of revenue. We continue to be pleased by our ability to drive increased profitability through leverage in adjusted gross margin, adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow while also maintaining strong revenue growth. On a year-to-date basis, our free cash flow margin expanded to 19.2% and improved 900 basis points versus the prior period, and we're pleased to be well within our target range of 15% to 20% free cash flow margin. Briefly covering our GAAP results for Q3, gross profit was $244.1 million. Operating income was $80.4 million, and net income was $57.6 million. In regards to the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with cash, cash equivalent and invested corporate cash of $233.7 million and no debt outstanding. In regard to client held funds and interest income, our average daily balance of client funds was $2.8 billion in Q3. And we are estimating the average daily balance will be approximately $2.5 billion in Q4 with an average annual yield of approximately 380 basis points. Additionally, please note that our guidance includes the impact of this week’s 25 basis point interest rate increase, and although we expect the impact to be more material in future periods, we do not expect this to have materially impact on Q4 results given the recency of the increase in rates.  In regard to over our client workforce levels, the number of client employees on the platform was flat for January, February, March and April on a sequential basis in each month consistent with Q2 and versus only a nominal increase in Q1 on a sequential basis. Our guidance continues to assume overall flat client workforce levels for the rest of the fiscal year.  With that, I’d like to provide our financial guidance for Q4 and full fiscal 2023. For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, total revenue is expected to be in the range of $299.2 million to $303.2 million, or approximately 32% growth over fourth quarter fiscal 2022 total revenue. And adjusted EBITDA is expected to the range of $93.5 million to $96.5 million. And for fiscal year 2023, total revenue is expected to be in the range of $1.165 billion to $1.169 billion or approximately 37% growth over fiscal 2022 and adjusted EBITDA is expected to be in the range of $368.1 million to $371.1 million, implying an adjusted EBITDA margin of approximately 31.7% and representing leverage of 380 basis points versus last fiscal year. In conclusion, we are pleased with our Q3 results and we’re pleased to raise fiscal 2023 guidance to 37% growth of the midpoint, which in combination with the adjusted EBITDA margin represented in our full year guide exceeds the Rule of 68 for fiscal 2023. We remain confident in our ability to support 20% plus revenue growth going forward and also remain committed to driving increased adjusted gross margin, adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow leverage on an annual basis.

Congrats on the great quarter and thanks for taking my questions here. I guess I have a couple, Steve, let’s start about – start with the AI topic of the year so far. You mentioned AI Assist and how it will help your customers communicate better? But as you think more holistically across the HR space over the next couple of three years, how can AI impact both your product and maybe the industry products even more so than what you’re already seeing today?"}
{"doc_type": "earnings_call", "ticker": "PCTY", "period": "2023_Q3", "date": "2023-05-04", "section": "qa", "speaker": "Steve Beauchamp", "text": "Sure. I think, you know, most of the AI use cases you see early in the cycle really revolve around writing assistance. And clearly that’s going to evolve very quickly over time and there’s lots of examples within the HR suite where that can be helpful. You can think of things like job descriptions as another example, performance reviews, lots of places where you need to provide written communication to employees that having an assistant to be able to make sure that you’re really getting your point across or potentially getting people excited or energized with an announcement. You can get assistance from an AI perspective. And I think we see a lot of those initial use cases is where we will add AI Assist into our platform and deliver value to our clients. But over time, the algorithms start to become much more complicated. You’ll see us impacting modern workforce index over time with new ideas for clients to be able to engage with employees differently and really drive higher retention and higher attraction from new employee perspective and better culture. And so we’re really excited about the opportunity to embed AI Assist throughout the platform."}

I’m just curious if there are any other feature updates that you’d point to that you and customers are most excited about? And then if anything could be meal [ph] movers in 2023 or beyond?"}

So we’ve had a great history of being able to release improvements based off client feedback. We believe strongly and client is a co-creator. And so you listed several examples that we got feedback from our clients and we continue to improve our product and you’ll also see more modern capabilities used in other software platforms be inserted. So we just talked about AI Assist, but things like chat are another great example, leveraging all the mobile connections. I think Toby had some examples in the prepared remarks to really drive higher level of employee engagement, and so you’ll see us continue to improve the platform on ongoing basis. And then from a new product perspective, we’ve more than doubled the amount of product we’ve sold since our IPO and we are pretty confident with a rich product pipeline that we’ll be able to continue that trend going forward and add new modules that are also monetizable at the same time."}

I just wanted to quickly follow up on investments into sales and product development that you’ve been announcing.

Especially to try to get the talented folks you’re looking at examples like software engineer or data practices security, all pretty hot market still despite the fact that there’s been some macro layoffs by the others in the tech org. But we’ve been continuing to hire as I go back to, we’re really excited about what we’ve got from a product pipeline perspective. We’ve gotten great ROI on our previous years product investments. Average revenue per customer has been a strong performance for us, and that’s been driven by the new product introductions that we’ve got. So we understand that things are a little bit more uncertain from a macro perspective. But we’re sticking kind of to the strategy. And at the same time we’re able to deliver pretty strong leverage. And so we feel like we can balance the investments in product going forward, take advantage of the feedback we’re getting from our customers and come out with new monetizable opportunities going forward which has been a key component of our strategy historically."}

And I think we've got a history of being able to come into the year fully staffed with the headcount that we think we need to be able to support the growth in the fiscal.

I think Steve's comments before, we've had a history of product innovation that I think has helped both create differentiation and also create the performance as we're looking at any future fiscal year. And I think we've got an ops team in place that's done a great job of coming through the busiest time of the year for us and set us up for success as we close out the fiscal year. And so I mean, I think, we're at the planning point for what fiscal 2024 is going to look like. But I think we are positive on the momentum that we've seen in the business, both from a sales perspective and from an operational standpoint."}

The only thing I would add is just from a macro perspective, obviously, we've had the tailwind of interest revenue this year, which has really been an industry tailwind. And then we really haven't seen any growth in pace per. So on a normal kind of low-growth GDP environment, you do typically get pace per growth. And so as we go into next year, you don't get that necessary interest revenue tailwind, and we're anticipating no pace per type growth. So as Toby said, we're pretty confident with all the things that we can control from an execution perspective, but those are a couple of things from a macro to be aware of."}

I think for the third quarter, as I said in the prepared remarks, the average daily balance was about $2.8 billion. The average yield, if you back into that, was 360 to 370 basis points and we guided to – Q4 to about 380 basis points. So I think our expectation is continue to step up in yield, as you've seen consistently each quarter this fiscal year. Obviously, we got a 25 basis point rate increase yesterday. The impact of that in Q4 is negligible, but you will see the yields continue to build in Q4 as you have earlier part of the year."}

And I mean, just staying on the topic, just how are you thinking about the momentum into Q4? Because it looks like things are going really well. And perhaps you can comment a little bit with regards to the sales pipeline and the implementations and particularly, if you're seeing any more traction on the upper end of the market, as you mentioned during prior quarters."}
{"doc_type": "earnings_call", "ticker": "PCTY", "period": "2023_Q3", "date": "2023-05-04", "section": "qa", "speaker": "Steve Beauchamp", "text": "Sure. So yes, I think you're right. We've had really good execution in the quarter and throughout the fiscal year from a sales perspective. As you go into next quarter and you look at our guidance, it starts to look very similar to pre-COVID type activity. So we're anniversarying a lot of the noise from COVID tailwind. So I think that's one thing to kind of think about is it's kind of getting back into, we were kind of in that 20-plus category, and we're focusing on that and we're executing above that pre COVID. There's been a lot of headwind early on and tailwind late. And so I think you're going to get back to a more normalized quarter as we go into the fourth quarter of the fiscal year. But we've been executing really well across all market segments. I would still highlight the upper end of that market. Probably if you were to say, which is probably the place you're executing the best that would still be a highlight."}

I guess it's been asked a couple of times. It does not sound like you're seeing any macro headwinds at the moment. I guess if you -- as you look towards 2024, you just talked about seeing better traction up market. Do you see any lengthening in sales cycles? Any -- maybe, again, as sales cycles take longer, approvals take more time that close rates are, again, stretched out or impacted by that? And then how do you think about how is the importance of global in kind of the incremental traction, incremental bookings opportunity for fiscal 2024? It appears to be increasingly important in the ecosystem."}
{"doc_type": "earnings_call", "ticker": "PCTY", "period": "2023_Q3", "date": "2023-05-04", "section": "qa", "speaker": "Steve Beauchamp", "text": "Maybe I'll start with the global part of the answer. We acquired Blue Marble to be able to have a global offering where companies can be paid through a network of providers in a number of countries around the world. And so, we've integrated that business into the rest of our organization. And now when we look at that it's very much a customer that might be on the Blue Marble platform, but also on the Paylocity platform. And so we think that's been a nice differentiator for us. It also creates a nice revenue stream on top of that. I think, though, it's still relatively small compared to the rest of our business. And so we think about that as now being kind of part of our core strategy and not so separate and certainly being helpful, even more so from a differentiation perspective than a new revenue stream."}

Maybe first one, just if I strip out as kind of the implied float contribution, gross margins on the core software side is still up really nicely year-over-year. I'm just curious maybe what's driving that underlying increase beyond scale or if there's anything that's changed in terms of what maybe your hosting costs are or what's maybe supporting that gross margin expansion outside of just float side."}
{"doc_type": "earnings_call", "ticker": "PCTY", "period": "2023_Q3", "date": "2023-05-04", "section": "qa", "speaker": "Ryan Glenn", "text": "Yes. Samad, I can take that one. I think as you said, we're really pleased with, I think, leverage across the business, certainly from a gross margin perspective, almost 300 basis points of leverage in the quarter. And as you outlined, stripping out the float impact, I think you're still at about 100 basis points. So nothing I'd call out there from a one-time perspective. I think it's – as the business continues to scale, you're driving efficiencies and scale and automation in those teams. And at the same time, we feel really good about the service and implementation and overall ops experience we're driving for clients. So I think it's just that continued strategy of investing in that part of the business, but at the same time, driving efficiencies."}

As you think about the nature of the typical customer conversation that you're having right now, is it more about how to leverage better what's called the incremental modules or the products that they have adopted over the last 18 to 24 months [indiscernible] what seems to be just largely kind of understood world of where people are working? Or is it more about how do they get new tools to better manage the world that we're in, right? So is it kind of better leveraging what they already have or finding more?"}

So I think it starts with how do we really digitize all of our back-office HR processes. And ultimately, that puts more control in the hands of employees and managers and saves the HR team time. That's still a big part of the equation. And then on top of that, part of the equation then is with the time that you save, what are you going to be doing from a strategic perspective? And that's really driving initiatives to create the right culture, to make an engaging environment, to drive productivity. And that's where a lot of the new tools come into the equation. And that's where you've seen things like surveys and LMS and Community and video really create a better engaging experience. That always becomes part of the conversation, but it still starts with how do you get as efficient as possible first."}

And so we’re – we continually invest and we believe that’s really part of the whole engagement and more modern platform story is our investments – multi-year investments in there. And we think we’ve got a pretty good pipelines of places that we can take either products like AI Assist or making modern workforce index more robust or being more predictive across our insights over time."}

But the primary focus for us is really continuing to gain market share when it comes to mid-market companies in the U.S."}

So I think from a functionality perspective, the first use case that we have enabled is many of our customers use community to actually communicate HR updates to their employees. And so they use our announcement feature to be able to do that. And sometimes that’s community we use to talk about events that they’re having. Sometimes it’s just updates of what’s happening in the organization, policy changes. It really replaces email for those customers. And at times, an HR team can spend a fair amount of time drafting those communications. And so AI Assist is built right into the community announcement feature and you can actually prompt it, you can ask it questions, you can ask it to change language, you can ask it to make it sound more exciting. All the things that you can normally do in ChatGPT. And so it really helps HR teams just be more efficient from an announcement perspective. That’s where we have it today. Community is a free feature available to all of our customers. We’re not monetizing that separate. But we certainly see an opportunity to take that type of capability and embed it in other places in the suite over time."}

That’s probably less of a comment from the quarter. But that’s really happened over the last couple years. And really that’s a function of all the new products and the new features that we’ve added. We’ve just been more competitive upmarket. And so no real changes in terms of our go-to-market motion or the success rate that we’ve had. We’re pretty happy, whether it’s a customer with 25 or 30 employees or whether they’ve got several thousand employees.

Thanks for taking my question. Maybe just to start with on the quarter, if you exclude sort of the upside from flow, which has been a nice tailwind for a while. The recurring upside from revenue in the quarter, maybe it wasn’t as big as we’ve seen in the last year or so. So maybe if you just dig in there, like is there something that you would call out in terms of execution in the quarter or maybe compare and contrast what drove such significant upside to your guidance last year that maybe isn’t repeating going forward?"}

I think, as we step back and look at the quarter results obviously, beat across the implied recurring and total and raise that plus for the year. So I think to the comments earlier, felt really good about the results in the quarter and the momentum within that sales team. I think the last few years you’ve had a little bit of noise in certain of those quarters. You obviously had some tailwinds from client workforce levels that weren’t factored into the guidance. So that was probably a bit of the overperformance you would’ve seen for the last six to eight quarters. I think it’s been a steady state as we outlined there. So no real tailwind. Retention has been high, continues to trend nicely that had been a little bit of upside in the past as well as that’s performed really well for the last few years. Outside of that, there’s nothing I would call out one time, I think feel really good about the beat and feel good about where Q4 headed as well."}

And then, this comment about employees and the platform being steady for a couple quarters. Obviously, there’s other data that I suggest that the job market is growing.

I’m just – I’m trying to sort of connect all the dots here…"}

It’s the same clients year-over-year and do they have more employees or less employees, right? And so there’s – that’s really kind of what we’re focused on. And in a normal, like if you go pre-COVID, GDP was in the low single digits. We were getting low single digit growth of employees on the platform. And if you’re in a recessionary time period and that’s kind of negative GDP, then you definitely see people kind of shedding employees on the platform. But if you go back, we’ve had many years of employee growth on the platform pre-COVID. And that’s probably the more normal state even when we are seeing 2% GDP growth, we are seeing a little bit of bump of employees on the platform. So the one difference from a macro perspective is we haven’t seen that and we’re not forecasting seeing that going forward. And so the employment numbers sometimes don’t exactly line up perfectly, but yes, there’s some jobs added. But unemployment rate hasn’t gone up and shifts. But generally speaking, I think if you think about it the way I just described versus something like a GDP number that’s what we’ve seen historically."}

I think Toby mentioned one of the earlier questions. We’ve had success getting up to that number last year that was kind of 18-ish percent. We’ve kind of been in that mid-teens growth rate for a while. We will give you the exact number on the next earnings call. But I think to echo Toby sentiments, we really feel good about where we are from a hiring perspective right now.

I think we’ve called out over the last, like I said, maybe even almost two years now, where we’ve been having a little bit more success with the larger end of the market. And so those are experienced people with industry experience that we bring on our core mid-market reps were probably a mix of non-industry, but yet B2B sales experience and industry reps. We definitely lean still heavily more towards industry reps. And then on the inside sales, you’re capturing kind of digital lead generation and handling those. And so those need less experience. And so we’re going to be potentially adding people across the board. We’re going through what that mix looks like, but if anything, it’s a slight shift to a little bit larger client that we’ve been generating that would likely continue as we forecast going forward. And maybe not quite as many on the small end. But we see opportunities to expand in all markets."}

Our differentiated value proposition of providing the most modern software in the industry, coupled with continued strong execution, resulted in excellent Q2 results and increased full year guidance. Total revenue was $273 million or 39.3% growth over Q2 of last year and exceeded the top end of our guidance by $12 million. Our continued strong sales momentum is the result of ongoing investments in product innovation, including leveraging last year's acquisition of Cloudsnap, a flexible low-code solution for integrating disparate business applications. We have fully integrated Cloudsnap into the Paylocity suite and are leveraging this technology to provide the most modern software in the industry to accelerate the role of new integrations and use cases to better serve our clients and their employees. To date, we developed nearly 2 dozen next-gen integrations across ERP, point-of-sale, time and labor and expense-related software that allow our clients to experience better data consistency by sharing employee benefits, financial and other key data elements more readily across their HR and other critical business systems. In addition, Cloudsnap's low-code integration capabilities has accelerated the extensibility of the Paylocity platform, helping to drive differentiation and incremental value to clients by positioning employee data and the Paylocity platform at the center of their application ecosystem. We continue to see strong attach rates in our modern workforce solutions as clients realize the value in creating a unique employee experience and engaging culture for remote, hybrid and in-office teams. Community and premium video whose new features centered on creating and sharing files, automating team groups and centralizing video management have allowed our clients and their employees to use our application in ways that stretch beyond traditional HCM functionality. This dynamic is reflected in our utilization metrics, where community monthly active users post and announcements continue to demonstrate strong growth on a year-over-year basis. Similarly, the number of videos created and played within our premium video offering continue to grow faster than the overall business as clients look to increasingly connect and engage with their employees through mediums that are more engaging than traditional e-mail. Our continued success in the market and commitment to product innovation continues to be recognized by third parties as Paylocity was recently named an overall leader in all 12 HRIS product categories in G2's Winter 2023 Grid report, including the number 1 overall leader in several categories, such as core HR, HR management systems, performance management and learning management. Similarly, the strong culture at Paylocity continues to be recognized externally as we receive the 2023 Built-in Best Places to Work award. I would now like to pass the call to Toby to provide further color on the quarter."}
{"doc_type": "earnings_call", "ticker": "PCTY", "period": "2023_Q2", "date": "2023-02-02", "section": "qa", "speaker": "Toby Williams", "text": "Thanks, Steve. Our focus on driving higher employee engagement, collaboration and connection once again contributed to strong results in Q2 as these underlying tenets of our modern workforce solutions have continued to drive increasing utilization of these products as we exit the pandemic. This dynamic was evident in Q2 across a wide range of clients, including an auto dealer with 1,200 employees across 22 locations that has seen employee survey participation increased to more than 70% since the rollout of Paylocity surveys, which directly led to updates on their fringe benefit policies and higher employee engagement. Similarly, an outdoor furniture manufacturer with over 1,800 employees has seen over 90% of its employees engage with the Paylocity mobile app to communicate, collaborate and recognize their peers. Combined with the ongoing investments we are making across our broader product suite, this commitment to innovating and building the most modern software platform in the industry contributed to strong sales execution in Q2 and helped set us up for a strong second half of fiscal '23. Consistent with the prior quarter, interest income on client funds continues to rise as a result of sustained interest rate increases from the Federal Reserve. Given the large market opportunity in front of us, we continue reinvesting a portion of this upside back into key areas of the business to help drive future growth. In addition to continuing our investments in digital marketing and our channel initiatives, which once again, delivered more than 25% of our new business in Q2, we will continue to incrementally invest across our product suite to further innovate and deliver the most modern software platform in the industry. This is also a very busy time of year for our operations teams as they work closely with clients on year-end processing of payrolls, W-2s, 1095s and annual tax form filings to federal, state and local agencies and the implementation of new clients. I want to thank all of our employees for their hard work and dedication to our clients during this very, very busy time of year.  I'd now like to pass the call to Ryan to review the financial results in detail and provide updated fiscal '23 guidance."}

Total revenue for the second quarter was $273 million, an increase of 39.3% with recurring and other revenues up 31.4% from the same period last year and $14 million ahead of our guidance midpoint. Our adjusted gross profit was 72.4% for Q2 versus 68.7% in Q2 of last fiscal, representing 370 basis points of leverage as we continue to focus on scaling our operational costs, while maintaining industry-leading service levels. We continue to make significant investments in research and development and to understand our overall investment in R&D is important to combine both what we expense and what we capitalize. On a dollar basis, our year-over-year investment in total R&D increased by 38.4% when compared to the second quarter of fiscal '22 and we remain focused on making incremental investments in R&D throughout fiscal '23 as we continue to build out the Paylocity platform to serve the needs of the modern workforce. In regards to our go-to-market activities, on a non-GAAP basis, sales and marketing expenses were 23.7% of revenue in the second quarter, and we remain focused on making incremental investments in this area of the business in fiscal '23 to drive continued growth. On a non-GAAP basis, G&A costs were 11.3% of revenue in the second quarter versus 13.3% in the same period last year, and we remain focused on consistently leveraging our G&A expenses on an annual basis. Our adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter was $77.4 million or 28.3% margin and exceeded the top end of our guidance by $10.9 million and represented 450 basis points of leverage versus Q2 of fiscal '22. We continue to be pleased by our ability to drive increased profitability through leverage and adjusted gross margin, adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow while also maintaining strong revenue growth. Briefly covering our GAAP results. For Q2, gross profit was $182.9 million, operating income was $18.2 million and net income was $15.6 million. In regards to the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $120.1 million and no debt outstanding. In regard to client-held funds and interest income, our average daily balance of client funds was $2.3 billion in Q2. We are estimating the average daily balance will be approximately $2.7 billion in Q3 with an average annual yield of approximately 320 basis points. On a full year basis, we are estimating the average daily balance will be $2.4 billion with an average yield of approximately 280 basis points. Additionally, please note that our guidance includes the impact of this week's 25 basis point interest rate increase and also assumes an increase of up to 25 basis points in March. In regards to client workforce levels, the number of client employees on the platform was flat in October, November, December and January on a sequential basis in each month, and as a reminder, was up only modestly on a sequential basis in Q1. Our guidance assumes client workforce levels to be flat for the remainder of the fiscal year. Finally, I'd like to provide our financial guidance for Q3 and full fiscal '23, which assumes no further changes in client workforce levels in the back half of this fiscal year. For the third quarter of fiscal '23, total revenue is expected to be in the range of $330.5 million to $334.5 million or approximately 35% growth over third quarter fiscal '22 total revenue. And adjusted EBITDA is expected to be in the range of $121.5 million to $124.5 million. And for fiscal year '23, total revenue is expected to be in the range of $1.156 billion to $1.161 billion or approximately 36% growth over fiscal '22, and adjusted EBITDA is expected to be in the range of $358.5 million to $362.5 million, which represents 320 basis points of leverage over fiscal '22. In conclusion, we are pleased with our Q2 results and the strong momentum we have carried in the back half of fiscal '23. With our fiscal '23 guidance of approximately 36% revenue growth at the midpoint and adjusted EBITDA margins of 31%, we are firmly above the rule of 60 in fiscal '23. We remain committed to continuing our history of driving profitable revenue growth while also increasing adjusted gross margin, adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow on an annual basis. Operator, we are now ready for questions."}

So we had a really good first half of the year overall. And I think even Toby mentioned talking about some of the sales momentum that we've had in our busy selling season and that allowed us to significantly raise the year. I think we have an advantage being the HCM business, payroll is something that every single company has to do. For us, it all starts with payroll and using the data from being payroll to be able to connect to the rest of the suite and obviously sell a much broader solution today. And so we've had continued success in terms of adding new units, and we've also had success in terms of selling more product and also even more success upmarket as we kind of called out over the last couple of calls."}

And then from a follow-up question, I know Ryan had mentioned that your R&D expense is up roughly 38% year-over-year. That's faster than your revenue growth right now. And I've called out many times, so I think your product innovation is driving your -- at least what I think there's some preseason win rate improvements over the last 2 years for the company. But how should we think about R&D investments going forward? Do you continue to step on the accelerator in a similar manner as you have been recently? Or is that an opportunity to maybe gain some financial leverage over because you're starting to, I don't know, hit as much product as you need to say."}

I think, Scott, our point has always been a combination of adding new units, landing those customers and then expanding the number of products that we've got. I think we have been fairly consistent being close to our revenue growth in terms of our investments in product and technology. We never viewed that as a big leverage point, we look for leverage elsewhere. We see big opportunity to add more modern capabilities to the suite additional products and revenue opportunities to the suite. And we certainly have not signaled any intention to be looking for leverage there, we think there's a fair amount of natural leverage in the business model in many other places as we scale. So I think the same approach as we've taken historically."}

We called out the Cloudsnap acquisition, the ability for us to integrate in our marketplace. We really view the data that we have about people to be really valuable to our customers, both from an automation perspective. But as we integrate with their broader suite of software that they're using to run their business, there certainly could be additional monetization opportunities. We are seeing that a little bit in the marketplace. We're at very early stages of continuing to expand the number of providers and leveraging the data that we have. So I don't think that -- all of our revenue has to be PPM, I think most of our revenue will continue to be PPM. But there's some opportunity for us to be able to leverage marketplace to potentially drive some referral revenue back to Paylocity as well."}

{"doc_type": "earnings_call", "ticker": "PCTY", "period": "2023_Q2", "date": "2023-02-02", "section": "qa", "speaker": "Steve Beauchamp", "text": "Yes. I would say that higher utilization, both in terms of the number of products that they use and then how much frequency their employees are logging in does translate to higher retention. It is a small difference. Quite frankly, there's a lot that goes into retention, right? The service elements are really important as well. But overall, we have historically segmented the customers based on utilization and number of products, and we've seen the customers who take advantage of the broader suite staying with us a little bit longer."}

That's obviously what allowed us to be able to raise the year and so both top-of-funnel activity in the larger end of the market, our core marketplace and even down market has been pretty strong. We definitely are seeing the modern suite the newer capabilities, the video product, community, survey, LMS, all really resonating even in a post-COVID environment where -- our clients are dealing with hybrid workforces. They're dealing with the demand more flexibility. Gen Z continues to grow in the marketplace. And so we would certainly credit to the combination of service and differentiated product as to our success that we've had so far."}

I think -- so maybe a couple of different points on this. I mean, there's no doubt that with the type of product, the type of software that we're offering in the market, there is an appreciable ROI that comes from both modernization and automating what would otherwise be manual tasks for folks. I think though, the core of the value prop that we're really focused on from a client or from a prospect pitch standpoint is really around the breadth of the platform, focusing on the fact that we do have the most modern platform in the industry and talking to people about what we can deliver from a value proposition standpoint that is certainly with the core of payroll, certainly with the core of the HCM suite, but really getting into all the things that we're offering that really go beyond the traditional HCM suite, whether that's things like community or what we're doing with the modern workforce index as we continue to expand the product set with things like Community Plus, what we're doing with video surveys and LMS really getting towards engaging with employees and giving clients the ability to engage with their employees in a more modern and differentiated way. So I think that's really the core beyond an ROI conversation of how we're having those types of client or prospect conversations in the market."}

And dangerously I guess my creative juices are flowing. You all help the idea of a modern platform and clearly, payroll, core HR and then talent management, you've got a lot of those capabilities, you keep adding more R&D. But what I'm curious about is I've been hearing software companies talked for a number of quarters now about this aspirational glove vendor consolidation, and that will benefit their business. So whether it's a premium video community, surveys, LMS or just talent management bundles, I'm not suggesting you're going to shift from trying to go after new logos, but is there an incremental opportunity to almost have kind of a tactical selling effort back to the base to really drive kind of a vendor consolidation playbook?"}

Yes, so I mean, I think the main part of our motion from a go-to-market perspective has certainly been in terms of landing new units. No doubt about that. And I think what we're seeing as we do that is new clients onto the platform have tended to take a broader part of the suite, which we feel good about. I think though -- to your question, we have also had a distinct motion going back into the customer base as we've expanded the product set going from $200 for the full product set at the time of the IPO to where we sit over $400 today, [440]. I mean we have an opportunity to sell product back into the customer base, and we do have a dedicated team that does that. So I think what you've seen from us is, over the course of the last 4 years primarily set up and I think invest more in that back-to-base motion. And I think we've seen a reasonable amount of success with that."}

And I guess the follow-up question is up on the upmarket. I always like hearing examples of the auto dealership and then the furniture manufacturer. As you continue to iterate on your platform and you have more capabilities, whether it’s 1,000 employees plus or do you feel like you could keep getting pulled higher up in the market? Or what could you share a little bit strategically how you think about that kind of upmarket opportunity over the next 2 to 3 years?"}

We’ve always focused on as we build new products, we build the capabilities that we think our average sized customer a little more than 100 employees we really need. And then what happens is as we get more customers, we see more demand from our customers and we really kind of live in product and technology on the ID of customers of cocreator. And so they request features and we continue to enhance the product. We keep teams in an agile fashion, constantly building on top of that product and the product gets richer in terms of the feature set. And that starts to appeal to larger customers. And so what you’ve seen over time is as our talent modules have matured, as we’ve added some of these newer modern capabilities, we are starting to see differentiation even upmarket where they are starting to think about how do they engage employees and going beyond automation. We don’t think that, that goes to the moon, quite frankly. We’ve just increased the target market about a year ago or so, and we’re having success in that marketplace. So it’s possible that, that stretches a little bit over time, but I would be more focused on what Toby just said, which is we’ve got a really big opportunity in the market that we’re in very low market share. And so we plan on focusing on capturing many customers in our existing target market is possible."}

Can you add a little bit more dimensionality with regards to how that's helping in terms of getting new clients? What are you seeing from a sales productivity perspective?

So Mark, we've had kind of a marketplace where our clients can connect disparate applications to the employee data that we have. And certainly, we can do that in a real-time fashion from an API perspective. And we do that with some of our larger providers that get asked more frequently. On the flip side, you've also got customers who may have vertical market applications or whose applications may not be quite ready for real-time API capabilities. And then it takes a while to build those integrations, and we've got a team with technical services team who's been doing this for years. Cloudsnap really enables that team to operate so much faster using the low-code capabilities that they bring to the table. And so we can configure integrations so much faster, and they also become much more scalable on a go-forward basis using that technology. And so for us, it really opens up the landscape of number of providers that we can integrate with and it also gives us increased speed to market for those integration and longer-term scalability."}

Certainly, upmarket clients are definitely demanding integration into their disparate system. But even if you've got 35 employees, you'd love that connection into your accounting system as well. And so the scalability portion really helps downmarket in terms of us to be able to scale that to a broader set of customers. Upmarket, we may find vertical market applications that don't necessarily have horizontal penetration across all of our markets. Using Cloudsnap, we can get those vertical market application, ERP integrations up relatively quickly as well. So I think it's really helpful across the entire target market."}

So I think broadly speaking, ERP applications would be one of the most common areas and certainly, the accounting portion of that is a key integration. But if you think about it, employee data ends up being kind of at the center of many workflows and processes at an organization we know when people are hired. They know in the term, they know the supervisory changes. We know a lot of information about the employees that, from a workflow perspective, you can power into other applications and create even more automation for clients. So although we're seeing a fair amount of demand in ERP, point-of-sale systems is another great example, vertical market applications, another great example. And so we're seeing a fair amount of demand, and we're excited about fill that demand with Cloudsnap capabilities."}

Third quarter, as we outlined in the prepared remarks, a $2.7 billion plant held fund balance average there, 320 basis points of annual yield and I think if you do the math in the fourth quarter, we're expecting about $2.6 billion of client funds in the fourth quarter with about 3.4% to 3.5% annual yield."}

If I think about the F 3Q guidance, it kind of gives us an early peek into F 4Q and I know the world is changing right underneath our feet at all times, but it implies kind of a low 20s recurring revenue growth rate. You guys have been growing well above that. And we're big fans and there's a lot of momentum behind the business. I'm just kind of thinking, should we expect growth to -- is that conservative because of macro? Or is that just the comps get tougher? Or is that just -- how should we think about that, especially in the context of where the business momentum has been and where it was prior to COVID?"}
{"doc_type": "earnings_call", "ticker": "PCTY", "period": "2023_Q2", "date": "2023-02-02", "section": "qa", "speaker": "Toby Williams", "text": "So I guess the way I would think about this is if you go back to the fiscal year prior to COVID, we were in that sort of mid-20s-ish performance range from a recurring revenue growth perspective. And at that point in time, we were guiding in the low 20s. And I don't think our guidance philosophy has changed from then until now. And what we had talked about at that point in time was continuing to operate the business and drive the business and invest in the business to be able to come out the other side of everything that was pandemic related with similar growth profile. And I think that's what we've talked about over the course of the last handful of quarters is as you start to get clear of some of the noise in the comps which we thought would be the back half of this fiscal year and in particular Q4, you would start to see more normalized growth rates that probably start to look a lot like they did pre-COVID, certainly in a much bigger business. But -- and I think that's what we're starting to see. I mean if you sort of unpack some of the dynamics there, Ryan called out that we are seeing really flat performance from an employee on the platform perspective. We have continued -- so that has been a tailwind starting to comp some of those increases and so that starts to flatten out. I think you also -- from a demand perspective, Steve made some of these comments, we have continued to see a reasonably strong demand environment. The sales execution has been good, which we feel good about. I don't think you're seeing any -- I don't think we're any -- displaying any particular conservatism as it relates to the macro. We're certainly aware of the macro concerns. But from a performance perspective, have continued to see a strong demand environment. I think you're just starting to see us normalizing in Q4 back to pre-pandemic level of growth rates as we get through some of the noise that was in the comps, which is pretty consistent with how we've talked about things over the last handful of quarters."}

Are you getting both a -- obviously, your primary advocates turn out to be the HR department, but are you getting more in different buyers inside of the organization. Is that giving you access to maybe more dollars or budget that may not have been previously thought of going through that department? Or is that they're able to allocate to you?

I think the buyers for the most part, have stayed very much the same, meaning it's typically your Head of HR and also your CFO as part of that decision-making process. Historically, we would involve CEOs at times, but it would probably be more from an approval perspective. I would tell you that we've had better CEO conversations when we start talking about how you engage employees like you drive retention, how you're driving productivity in employees with things like LMS, how you're gathering feedback and making changes based off that feedback. So this engagement concept really does appeal to a CEO. You think people are the most important asset of any company. And so the ability to onboard new employees to drive productivity to make sure that retention is high to attract talent, I think we definitely -- although the HR and CFO buyer are still the key buyers, I think we've extended the value proposition such that we've got more conversations and access to the actual CEO."}

So we're fairly early in that, we sometimes get off to a little bit of a head start when we can, and we always do that opportunistically, but the hiring season is really ahead of us. I think really good success from a product and technology perspective, great retention in that group. You can see we've had pretty good year-over-year increase in investments there. We're excited about the pipeline to that organization. And we went into the year-end, really fully staffed just from an operations perspective because it's a really important time here to be there for our customers and to be able to deliver the service that they need. So overall, we feel really good about the staffing levels and the employee value proposition that we're selling in the market, a growth company in the software space that's not looking to reduce expenses, but looking to develop talent and promote people and continue to grow really resonate.

I think if you think about the guidance philosophy we've had all the way back to the start of the pandemic, Obviously, there's been a lot of uncertainty over that period of time. And I think the approach that we've taken is we've guided to what's in front of us, and we've done that here again this quarter. As I outlined in the prepared remarks, workforce levels have effectively been flat since August and up modestly in July, and that's our expectation for the balance of the fiscal year. To the extent things get a little bit tighter, we see some expansion in the other way. I think that's sort of the movement within the guidance range. But sitting here today, coming off of a really strong selling season and a great January, I think we feel good about where the overall revenue guidance sits and obviously watching the macro closely but have not seen any impact within the client base. And likewise, from a sales perspective, continue to feel really good about the demand environment."}

And so really happy with how that's worked out and the value that's been able to add in the process. I think Steve made the comments on the last quarter call that we're still in the process of fully integrating the Blue Marble capabilities into the platform. And I think that's typical of how we would sort of approach any acquisition that we do, the processes that we bring something in and we'll then spend the time which could take anywhere between 12 and 24 months to fully bake capabilities into our platform in a seamless way from a user experience perspective, from a data flow perspective. And so the teams are still working on that and feel good about the progress so far. Certainly, we continue to have the overall bandwidth to look at acquisitions that might be interesting. I think our point of view historically remains the case today. We would prefer to always develop the next capability that we want to push out from a product perspective. But I think we've also taken advantage of, in certain instances, the ability to accelerate things that might be really strategic to us, that it might be on the product road map by way of what's largely been, I would characterize as smaller product-oriented or technology-oriented tuck-in acquisitions.

So 401(k) integration, as an example, Benefits integration would be another point of integration. And then you get into all this stuff, I mentioned prior ERPs and so on and so forth. So I think there's an opportunity to expand the number of integrations to the way I think about it. I would imagine we would have to see a future where every client has at least 1 integration. And over time, we want to actually drive the number of integrations so that they can really leverage the people data that we have. And in a real time, workflow capability. They know when something changes about that person, that will then enable 1 of their processes to create automation and create an opportunity to have higher levels of engagement. And so our viewpoint is clients, we want to integrate with all of the systems that they use to run their business that lever people data. That's the goal and objective."}

We've been investing for several years now kind of in machine learning, artificial intelligence capabilities. You see that surfacing our product already in a few different places, and we do see many more opportunities as well. So one is our modern workforce index, where we look across our clients, and we score customers based off how engaged they are in our platform. And we know the higher the score, the more employee retention they have. And we do that even by vertical markets. So we compare hospitality to other hospitality. And then as they start to use more of the product, they see their score's going up, so the recommendation engine behind that starts to give them ideas on how they can get more value out of the product. We also will surface recommendations even to employees around people that they might want to connect with, that they might want to communicate, that they might want to follow a community that's certainly another place. And then lastly, I would just say our dashboards and insights is another place that we try to surface that.

And I think, as Toby mentioned earlier, when you've got such a huge TAM in front of you and a market opportunity, that's really important to have differentiation. I think that capability can be a component of new offerings that we have. I'm not sure we see at least in the immediate future that we would charge for a separate SKU on some of these capabilities. But as we launch new products, being able to incorporate things like recommendation engine, leveraging all the data that we have across the organization, get our clients to see best practices and implement new more modern capabilities.

Just a couple of quick other questions. One is on this kind of employment levels, I mean, are you able to quantify how much of your growth comes from basically increased employment at existing clients? I know in the past, you have kind of outlined rate increases offset any sort of employment pressures. But are you able to quantify like over the last couple of years, how much of your growth has come from employee expansion at existing clients?"}

I think if you think about in a normalized environment with a growing GDP, you may get 1 point, maybe 2 in a normal period with client workforce levels. Obviously, over the last 3 years or so, you've seen significant movements both ways. I think if you anchor back to the pandemic, we talked about up to a double-digit impact on recurring revenue in fiscal '20 that bled over into fiscal '21. And then again, I think if you look at where we were from a spring of '21 all the way towards the summer of 2022, we saw nearly every single month sequential improvements. And as we talked about each of those quarters, that has been a reasonable tailwind and you've seen outsized recurring and total revenue growth over that period of time. To Toby's point earlier, as you think about the back half of the fiscal year, year-over-year, there's still a little bit of a tailwind here in the third quarter. As you get to the fourth quarter, I think we've really fully anniversaried all of the client workforce levels improvements that we've seen over the last handful of years. And you get back to that kind of low 20s or so recurring revenue growth. And as we sit here and think about fiscal '24, continue to have a lot of confidence around go-to-market motion and our ability to continue to drive 20% plus as we get back to that more normalized employment environment."}

Samad kind of asked this question about your Q4 numbers, around conservatism. It sounds like you're not seeing any change in employment levels in your customers, you're not even really seeing any change in sales cycle times in your customer base for new logos. I guess, how -- is there a reason that you guys have been able to decipher as to why that is or when you would be anticipating seeing that impact from the macro economy? Or is there just a level of resiliency either from a share market perspective or type of client perspective that you serve that gives you that resiliency on the recurring revenue line. And maybe it's also just the mix of SMB versus larger customers that you're serving in your business. But would love to get some -- just further clarity on that."}
{"doc_type": "earnings_call", "ticker": "PCTY", "period": "2023_Q2", "date": "2023-02-02", "section": "qa", "speaker": "Steve Beauchamp", "text": "Sure. So obviously, been in this industry, really my whole career, and I've seen the different cycles. But the interesting part, I think, to me about this cycle is you still have relatively low unemployment levels. And certainly, the headline news, there are people reducing their workforces, but there are still a number of jobs out there, and we're still in a growth environment. There's been a lot of lumpiness post COVID. The other thing I would say is hybrid work, people moving from 1 industry to the next, there's a lot of resilience in terms of being able to move from 1 job to the next, being able to work from home anywhere in the country. And so I think the labor force can react relatively quickly as we've seen these maybe shifts in demand, as you said, from white-collar jobs. And overall, when I look at the longer-term history is GDP is growing a little bit, employment usually trails at a little bit from a percentage basis. If it's declining a little bit, it's also going to decline trailing GDP. And sometimes unemployment numbers can take a couple of months before you see it all the way through. But if you think of all those headlines, we've been flat for several months in terms of employment levels. And that, frankly, makes sense to me based on what I've seen historically. Now that doesn't mean that, that's certainly going to continue. We have forecasted kind of a flat environment on our guidance for the rest of the year. But I think there's a fair amount of resilience in this type of employment environment where people can move from one job to the next relatively quickly because of the rise remote work."}

It's super simple and super interesting that the labor mobility, effectively if one of your clients loses somebody they'll pop right up at 1 of your other clients. I guess 1 other question I have is, as I look at the OpEx umbrella, it does look like for the first kind of -- this quarter specifically, your growth in sales and marketing is meaningfully ahead of the recurring revenue growth on a year-over-year basis, which I guess, to some extent, makes sense because it's aligned with your total revenue growth, what do we -- when you think about your ability to kind of almost not overinvest, but invest ahead at a level that maybe you haven't been able to invest in the last couple of years, what are you -- if we think about the reaping the rewards of that kind of front-loaded sales and marketing investment that you're able to make in the first half of this year, is it -- do you anticipate it kind of driving greater growth durability, greater growth rate when -- particularly when we start anniversary-ing some of those tougher comps."}

We felt really good about the growth opportunity in front of us based on having relatively low share of a very large market. I think what the message has been is we would continue to invest in -- certainly in sales and marketing, in sales headcount and in marketing and in channels, a lot of that being in the form of digital marketing, support for our channel initiatives, which continue to drive 25% plus of new business to us. And I think what you're seeing in the first half of this year is the continued progress and the continued sort of motion against that strategy. And I think we came into this fiscal year feeling really good about our staffing levels from a sales headcount perspective, and I think our strategy on an ongoing basis has been to continue to add talent in those areas where we can, given that from an overall business perspective, sales and marketing is certainly along with product, one of the big growth-driving areas of the business. And so I think you've just seen us continue to incrementally invest there in the first half of the year, pretty consistent with how we've described it historically."}

Sales and marketing to drive continued revenue growth or R&D, which you also see this fiscal year. And offsetting that, you're seeing the scale and leverage across the areas that we focused on historically and continue to do so. So really strong gross margin leverage this quarter, year-to-date, really strong G&A leverage this quarter and year-to-date. And I think if you add all that together, it allows us to drive in this quarter, over 400 basis points of of leverage from an adjusted EBITDA perspective while investing incrementally, both in sales and marketing and R&D.

Let me start. I would just start by saying from a visibility perspective, our model being recurring revenue and the fact that a big part of our revenue is retaining the existing customers. And then you overlay new customers and new recurring revenue as the year goes along. So think about it as we go along in that year, we get greater visibility to only 2 quarters left. Obviously, January being a huge part of our selling season. At this stage, we have better visibility than we certainly did last quarter and significant visibility because we know what our retention rates are and we've got pretty decent look into the pipeline of new business. And so it's just 1 of the benefits, I think, of this business model that we've got. I don't think, though, like at the size and scale that we're at now, versus maybe 3 or 4 years ago pre-COVID, there's a different level of visibility. I think it's just more inherent in the business model and where we're driving the revenue from."}

Our solid results continued into fiscal '24, with total revenue growth of 25% as a differentiated value proposition of providing the most modern software in the industry continues to resonate in the marketplace. Recurring and other revenue was $291.7 million or 19% growth over Q1 of last year. Our growth continues to be fueled by our ongoing commitment to driving innovation and revolutionizing the way organizations engage with their employees as highlighted by the recent announcement of two new product releases, Rewards & Recognition and Employee Voice. Embedded throughout the Paylocity platform Rewards & Recognition is designed to help clients improve employee retention by automating and customizing both peer and manager feedback across work anniversaries, birthdays and every moment of achievement through personalized recognition and rewards programs. Similarly, Employee Voice combines AI with our proprietary statistically validated engagement model to improve upon our existing survey functionality and help clients aggregate analyze and act on employee feedback at a much larger scale and ultimately a driver of greater employee engagement and talent retention. Following the release of these solutions, our PEPY opportunity now sits at 550 and we remain confident in our ability to achieve our target of 600, as we continue to develop the most modern product suite in the industry. Our innovation continues to be recognized by third parties, as Paylocity was recently named an overall leader in 10 product categories in the G2 Quarterly Bridge Reports for the 20th consecutive quarter across multiple segments. One, the Brandon Hall Group HCM Excellence Award and bank's Top five Vendor across 14 User Experience and Vendor Satisfaction Categories in safe Annual HR System Report. I would now like to pass the call to Toby to provide further color on the quarter."}

In October, we held our annual Elevate Client Conference, where we hosted several thousand business leaders, representing HR, finance, IT and operations across dozens of sessions over the course of two days. At Elevate, attendees had the opportunity to earn shim credits, in addition to partnering with our product and service teams to help influence our future road map through our client as co-creator philosophy. This dynamic was exemplified by the 10 organizations that won our inaugural Elevate award honoring forward-thinking HR teams that are solving business challenges through innovative use of technology. And a big thank you to our employees, clients and partners for helping create the best Elevate conference we've had to-date. While at Elevate, we also have the opportunity to connect with several clients that are leveraging our new solutions, including an engineering firm with over 300 employees that is utilizing market pay to make data-driven decisions around employee compensation and ensure that they remain competitive in the recruitment of new talent, while also maintaining fair compensation for their existing employees. In addition to Rewards & Recognition and Employee Voice, we also announced the launch of our next-generation mobile application, which continues to redefine how our clients' employees are able to interact with key HR functions regardless of whether they are in the office working from home or on the go. Today's workforce is more distributed and reliant on mobile devices than ever before and we continue to see increasing mobile versus desktop usage. This growing demand for modern employee-driven solutions continues to be reflected in solid demand across our target market, and we're pleased with the momentum in our sales team heading into selling season. We're similarly happy with the consistency of our referral channel, which once again delivered more than 25% of our new business in Q1. The strong culture of Paylocity continues to be recognized externally, as we recently were named to Fortune's list of Best Employers for Women. Echoing Steve's comments, I would like to thank all of our more than 6,000 employees for a strong start to fiscal 2024. I would now like to pass the call to Ryan to review the financial results in detail and provide updated fiscal 2024 guidance."}
{"doc_type": "earnings_call", "ticker": "PCTY", "period": "2024_Q1", "date": "2023-11-02", "section": "qa", "speaker": "Ryan Glenn", "text": "Thanks Toby. Total revenue for the first quarter was $317.6 million, an increase of 25% with recurring and other revenues up 19% from the same period last year. Our adjusted gross profit was 73.4% for Q1 versus 72.1% in Q1 of last year, representing 130 basis points of leverage, as we continue to focus on scaling our operational costs, while maintaining industry-leading service levels. We continue to make significant investments in research and development and to understand our overall investment in R&D, it is important to combine both what we expense and what we capitalize. On a dollar basis, our year-over-year investment in total R&D increased by 21% when compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2023 and we remain focused on making incremental investments in R&D throughout fiscal 2024 as we continue to build out the Paylocity platform to serve the needs of the modern workforce. In regard to our go-to-market activities on a non-GAAP basis sales and marketing expenses were 22.2% of revenue in the first quarter and we remain focused on making incremental investments in this area of the business in fiscal 2024 to drive continued growth. On a non-GAAP basis, G&A costs were 10.3% of revenue in the first quarter versus 12% in the same period last year and we remain focused on consistently leveraging our G&A expenses on an annual basis. Our adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter was $104.9 million, or 33% margin and exceeded the top end of our guidance range by $12.4 million and represented nearly 700 basis points of leverage versus Q1 of fiscal 2023. Briefly covering our GAAP results. For Q1, gross profit was $216.1 million, operating income was $41.2 million, and net income was $34.5 million. In regard to the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $305 million and no debt outstanding. In regard to client-held funds and interest income, our average daily balance of client funds was approximately $2.3 billion in Q1. We are estimating the average daily balance will be approximately $2.4 billion to $2.5 billion in Q2, with an average annual yield of approximately 435 basis points. On a full year basis, we are estimating the average daily balance will be approximately $2.5 billion to $2.6 billion with an average yield of approximately 420 basis points. While the demand environment for new business remains solid, year-over-year employees on the platform growth came in below our expectations for Q1 providing a headwind to the quarter and the fiscal year. Finally, I'd like to provide our financial guidance for Q2 and full fiscal 2024. For the second quarter of fiscal 2024, total revenue is expected to be in the range of $322.5 million to $326.5 million, or approximately 19% growth over second quarter fiscal '23 total revenue and adjusted EBITDA is expected to be in the range of $100 million to $103 million. And for fiscal year 2024, total revenue is expected to be in the range of $1.405 billion to $1.410 billion, or approximately 20% growth over fiscal 2023 and adjusted EBITDA is expected to be in the range of $474 million to $478 million, which represents approximately 200 basis points of leverage over fiscal 2023. In conclusion, we are pleased with our Q1 results and the momentum we have across our sales and operations teams as we enter our busiest time of the year. Operator, we are now ready for questions."}

So I think what we saw in the quarter was a little bit of softness in August and September which as we had talked about we did not assume a decline there in Q1. So a little bit light versus expectations. That obviously weighed a bit on the recurring revenue in Q1. And I think we factored that in as we looked at maintaining guidance for the full fiscal year. So probably didn't put a full dollar amount on it, but certainly a headwind in the quarter and we did factor that in as I said over the balance of the fiscal year."}

And then from a follow-up question perspective is, how should we think about your cross-sell cadence for the year? I know you all have had a pretty strong emphasis last couple of years. But cadence in the quarter kind of similar to what you've seen in the last couple of years? Or is there any notable change on how your existing customers are buying new modules? Thank you."}

We have accelerated investments over the last several years and the inside sales team that is selling client - or products back to existing customers. At the same time, you can see we've accelerated our road map and we've added a lot of new product SKUs as well. And so those are being received really well within the customer base and we were pleased with the performance of that team in Q1."}

So I just maybe wanted to focus on the linearity and thinking about the recurring revenue guidance for the second quarter, because it seems like the full year implies an acceleration into the back half of the year. Is there anything in terms of enterprise mix or implementation or backlog that kind of drives that? I know we're seeing some moving parts in employment. But just kind of want to understand how you guys are thinking about linearity over the course of the year?"}
{"doc_type": "earnings_call", "ticker": "PCTY", "period": "2024_Q1", "date": "2023-11-02", "section": "qa", "speaker": "Ryan Glenn", "text": "Yes, Brian. I think as we called out on the August earnings call, we did say that the first half of the year probably had incrementally harder comps when you look at the recurring revenue growth that we saw in the first two quarters of last fiscal year and the normalization of workforce levels in the back half of this year and obviously some softness in the first quarter. So I think we took all that into account. Not anything else I'd call out relative to macro or the sales environment, but Steve anything you want to add there?"}
{"doc_type": "earnings_call", "ticker": "PCTY", "period": "2024_Q1", "date": "2023-11-02", "section": "qa", "speaker": "Steve Beauchamp", "text": "No. I think from our perspective execution was pretty much down the middle in terms of what we expected with the exception of seeing a little bit of the softness as Ryan described kind of sequentially month-over-month with a couple of the months in the quarter. But from a demand environment and activity levels, we feel pretty good about where we're positioned. This is obviously a really important time of the year for us, because you get a lot of starts in January. It's really the biggest time of the year. This is just the first quarter obviously. And so there's a lot of execution in front of us but we feel good with the start we got off to."}
{"doc_type": "earnings_call", "ticker": "PCTY", "period": "2024_Q1", "date": "2023-11-02", "section": "qa", "speaker": "Brian Peterson", "text": "Great. And maybe just as a follow-up. Obviously, this has been a big focus on the space this week. But just understanding kind of the revenue mix in any revenue streams that may not be tied to sort of a PPEY dynamic that are more transactional or onetime in nature. I don't think you guys have broken that out previously but any your help on kind of sizing that impact? I know, it's come up a lot this week. Thanks, guys."}
{"doc_type": "earnings_call", "ticker": "PCTY", "period": "2024_Q1", "date": "2023-11-02", "section": "qa", "speaker": "Steve Beauchamp", "text": "Yeah. I know. I understand the context of the question. So I think if you go back many years ago, the industry was highly payroll-centric and it was very transactionally fee-based and that ends up being billed on a per payroll basis. That was very common. As we move to modernize our suite in many, many years ago we made the transition to really be cloud-first provider and charge on a PEPM basis and so regardless of how many payrolls a customer runs they pay us the same amount on a per employee per month basis. And so we don't necessarily see any revenue variance from that model. That is something that was pretty common in some of the providers that have been around for a longer period of time. But I think from a customer experience perspective, it's much better to know exactly what your bill is going to be. It's based off a per employee per month. And the other thing, I would note is less than half of our revenue is payroll-based today. And so it's a bundled billing situation for our customers. So, no impact."}

So we were able to look at the first quarter and kind of have an early look at October and factor that into the guidance but we'll give you better color when we have the quarter behind us."}
{"doc_type": "earnings_call", "ticker": "PCTY", "period": "2024_Q1", "date": "2023-11-02", "section": "qa", "speaker": "Brad Reback", "text": "Okay. And Steve on that latter point there, can you give us any directional sense on the guide if you just assumed sort of the trends you're seeing right now if you've seen things get worse? Any way to size that up just so as we see the economy we can understand how it impacts you?"}
{"doc_type": "earnings_call", "ticker": "PCTY", "period": "2024_Q1", "date": "2023-11-02", "section": "qa", "speaker": "Steve Beauchamp", "text": "Yeah. So I mean, I think, we were able to obviously maintain our guidance for the year. We had a beat in the quarter. So I think just from a sizing perspective, this was not the biggest needle mover just in terms of the impact of employees on the platform. We've got essentially, a full look at the first three months and we get an early look at the fourth month and we've kind of factored that into the year, and we'll still be able to maintain our guidance for the year, and we feel pretty good about it. Knowing that, this is the first quarter of the year and in our business, there's a lot of sales that happen in the next quarter that gets started in January. So there's just -- I think traditionally if you look at the way we think about first quarter is we've got a lot of execution. We sell and implement a lot of businesses within that same quarter. And so I think it's a combination of seeing just a small amount of softness in employees on the platform and just the normal approach we take on a first quarter of fiscal year."}

We hire all throughout the year but I think you see hiring season for the sales team really in that spring timeframe. And I think as we've said, before we're really happy with the level of talent across the sales team really happy with the class that came in coming into this fiscal year. And as Steve said, I mean, we're right in the selling season. And so I think we came through Q1 really happy with the performance of the team and happy with where we sit from a staffing perspective as we came through Q1 this year and on into selling season."}

We kind of always -- we're focused on those when they became available but we definitely have seen increased traction up market. I think we've called that out probably over the last two years. I wouldn't have anything from a win rate perspective to tell you. They definitely have been pretty strong for us. If I were to look at first quarter which is kind of interesting I would call it broker referrals and really our core team as being the strength of the sales force in first quarter, which is from our perspective the largest part of the market and where we focus the most.

I mean maybe at the margins you might hear from spots in the sales force where it's taken a little bit longer for people to make decisions. But I wouldn't say that's uniform. I would say that we're hearing that a little bit at the margin. And that would be really the only call out."}

And I think as Steve has said feel pretty good about the momentum that we have coming out of Q1 part of that is certainly around Elevate and part of that I think is just how we're executing from an overall go-to-market perspective.

It looks like you picked up a little bit of yield still quarter-over-quarter. And as you may be thinking about extending duration as rates are staying higher for longer do you -- and with the reiterated guidance between 4.5% to 4.6%, do you expect that to continue until rates go down around those levels?"}

I mean, I think, we gave a fair amount of details in prepared remarks relative to average daily balance and yield. And I think we guided in a fairly tight range from a yield perspective between call it 420 basis points and 440 basis points of yield for the year. So I think we'll be in that range. We're certainly looking at the yield curve. We're looking at duration of the portion of client health funds that we do have invested. And I think as we go deeper into the year we'll update guidance accordingly if we see changes there."}

It's nice to see the PEPY go up to 550 with the two new modules. If I've got this correct. This is kind of the second quarter in a row where we've seen that current PEPY increase. I guess what's giving you this ability to accelerate the new offerings here? And how should we think about trajectory going forward?"}
{"doc_type": "earnings_call", "ticker": "PCTY", "period": "2024_Q1", "date": "2023-11-02", "section": "qa", "speaker": "Steve Beauchamp", "text": "Sure. I think if you go back a couple of years ago, you can see that we've made some incremental investments in R&D. We obviously had a little bit of tailwind in terms of interest revenue increases. So, we made some platform investments. We added a whole bunch of folks. We kicked off some new projects. And I think you're seeing the fruits of that labor come to market with four new recent product SKUs. I would tell you we feel really good about the pipeline from a product perspective. You probably have heard me say many times that we have lots of ideas that we have that we think can really help our customers and we get a lot of those ideas as customers a co-creator. And so the pipeline from a product perspective is pretty strong. And I think on the flip side, you see that we're able to do that while at the same time kind of normalizing kind of those R&D investments in the quarter and that's probably the right way to think about it is just a bit of a period of extra investment and you're seeing the benefit from it. But I feel like the investment level that we're at in terms of size and scale now really allows us to really balance investing in the client experience and making sure we're reacting to their feedback still funding all sorts of new products and making platform investments so that we can stay being the most modern platform in the industry."}

I think that really happy with the performance in the quarter and the ability to raise the year as much as we did. I think we're guiding to an adjusted EBITDA range of about 34% -- call it 34% or so. So, just about 100 basis points short of our updated target. So, I feel really good about that progress. Nothing that I would call out as far as one-time or additional areas of focus. I think it's really a function as the business gets larger that we're able to continue to drive scale, while at the same time investing to drive growth in the future."}

I guess maybe can you just talk about from those workforce levels were there any particular verticals that you saw either seeing anecdotally weaker workforce levels or that anecdotal commentary around taking longer around sales cycles or go lives. Anything there would be helpful."}
{"doc_type": "earnings_call", "ticker": "PCTY", "period": "2024_Q1", "date": "2023-11-02", "section": "qa", "speaker": "Steve Beauchamp", "text": "Yes, I would say again I want to just make sure that we talk about that as being kind of a small change in the workforce levels being a little bit less than we expected. So, just from an order of magnitude, this is not a huge impact. We definitely looked at other factors in terms of trying to figure out was this a pocket from a geography perspective or a vertical market. The reality was it's pretty much just across the board. As Ryan mentioned, if you look at it on a year-over-year basis it was up we expected it to be up. It just was not up the same amount. And then on a month-over-month basis, it was actually down two of the three months in the quarter. And so still a relatively small impact but something that we've kind of factored into the guidance. By no means that we think there is a whole bunch of client behavior that would be a sign of a very different environment than we're in but we definitely had that blip in the quarter."}

And I guess to the extent I know that this question has been asked, but as we think about it from a guidance particularly for the full year and even maybe just commenting on long-term targets that you guys gave at the Analyst Day, still feel -- do you still feel really good about those targets? And in terms of the full year moderating of employment levels. Is it just fair to assume that you've taken that -- the slight difference into account? Or have you been a little bit more conservative in the employment levels for the full year?"}

No, I mean we have not forecasted some different employment environment or some recession into what we've guided. We took what we saw in first quarter. We took the early look into October. We factored that into the balance of the year. That was certainly one of the biggest drivers in terms of just maintaining our guidance for the year versus taking that up. It's kind of all factored in. We feel good about the fact -- the execution in the business. And we're still focused on obviously those long-term objectives and we've got a rich product pipeline and a lot of momentum."}

{"doc_type": "earnings_call", "ticker": "PCTY", "period": "2024_Q1", "date": "2023-11-02", "section": "qa", "speaker": "Steve Beauchamp", "text": "Well, I think we've gone through many cycles in our history in the past. These things don't typically fall off a cliff quickly. It is a very gradual impact in a recurring revenue model. So it does give us the ability to kind of make adjustments in terms of what we're seeing in front of us. So that's the first thing that I would say. And we do have a fair amount of variable cost that really is assigned to the volume. And so it's relatively easy for us to adjust in any kind of down market if that's what we're seeing. We've actually had a lot of success selling in down markets in our past history as well. And so part of the value proposition that we're offering customers is efficiency that they gain from using a more modern platform. That value proposition does become pretty important in a tight market. And so you definitely lean into that. And I think even if you went back into COVID and the fact that we were able to sell through that which was certainly the biggest drop you've ever seen economically. So yes, I wouldn't say it doesn't affect us but I think our industry and I think the investments we've made in our product make us fairly resilient to that type of market fluctuation."}

It has been a core part of our growth equation for a long time. And we have obviously added significantly to the product. It was $200 at the time of IPO back in 2014. So we continue with that momentum. I already called out earlier in the call that we've had great ability to sell back into the client base. The attach rates for the new products used we've been happy with and we've got a pretty rich product pipeline. And so that is and continues to be a big part of the equation and we see these new customers continuing to adopt more product."}

{"doc_type": "earnings_call", "ticker": "PCTY", "period": "2024_Q1", "date": "2023-11-02", "section": "qa", "speaker": "Steve Beauchamp", "text": "Yes. I think for competitive reasons I never like to announce a product until we're very close to launching that and bringing that to market. What I would tell you is I think we continue to have opportunities to extend the valuable data that we have about an employee's person record to be able to automate a number of internal processes for our customers. Some of those really fit right into kind of a core HR organization. Some of those start to extend outside of that where that data can become valuable. We also have opportunity to be able to add deeper capabilities and functionality, very much like Scheduling Plus which was one of our new product SKUs that allow our customers to take advantage of richer functionality and it allows us to be able to get a little bit more pricing out of that equation. And so I think it's really kind of a combination of innovating in places where we don't see our competitors go on top of actually just making our functionality deeper and better. And then lastly, sometimes it's reacting to customer feedback. I think Rewards & Recognition is a great example of client feedback driving us to launch a SKU that maybe we wouldn't imagine three or four years ago. And so it's all three of those things that drive the innovation."}

And I think, as I mentioned a few minutes ago, I mean I think we are – came into the new fiscal year with sales headcount up 18%. That's the same level of increase generally, we've had the last few years. And I think we feel really good about the level of talent we've been able to attract. And as Steve said a minute ago, I think we're in the heart of selling season. And I think we feel pretty good about how the momentum that we had in the course of Q1 and feel really good about where we sit from a staffing perspective and from a talent level perspective as we sit here in the heart of selling season."}

And there's been certainly a lot of noise post-COVID in some of these numbers. And in some ways even some of the comparables on the first half of the year that we've got. But we feel focused on getting there. I think if you look at the guidance overall for the year we're right at the number implied a little bit lower but not a lot lower on the last couple of quarters. I think the other thing I would say is that's guidance, right, not always actuals as well. And so if you kind of factor all that in place we feel like we're – from a guidance perspective we're pretty darn close to the target already and we're going to stay focused on that number."}

But I think as it relates to some of the product announcements we've had, we've had a strong couple of quarters of new product introduction with things most recently like Rewards & Recognition and Employee Voice that Steve was talking about. And I think the overall reaction so far obviously, early days in terms of the launch of those products but the reaction so far has been great really strong. And I think those – to Steve's point a minute ago, I mean those continue to be products that we have collaborated with clients on we've gotten feedback from them and we've now delivered products that I think they are indicating of value to them. And so while it's early days I mean I think the reaction has been really strong so far."}

Maybe my first question and I did have a follow-up, either fortunately or unfortunately for you all. The first question is as we talk about growth algorithm – and Steve, I think you said it really well. I mean you've got the team on the field, you got to execute now and close business the rest of the year. So I totally get that. But what I'm curious is with what you know right now, how do you think the mix of growth in new revenue coming on would look between new units and average revenue per customer this year versus last year? Do you see any discernible potential changes in those mixes? And then I had a follow-up."}
{"doc_type": "earnings_call", "ticker": "PCTY", "period": "2024_Q1", "date": "2023-11-02", "section": "qa", "speaker": "Steve Beauchamp", "text": "Sure. Okay. So I think – I think you know this Terry but we quote our salespeople on new recurring revenue, not necessarily based off a specific number of units. I think over the last couple of years as we've had success upmarket and success with driving more product you've seen average revenue per customer play a bigger role. And the units obviously were a slightly smaller component of that. It just -- I think my reaction to that is we want to get to the number and we want the sales force to be able to go with what the customers need. And sometimes that means they're selling more customers and sometimes they're selling more product. But I think it's too early to be totally honest with you this year to be able to tell you whether we're going to see a specific mix shift."}

And maybe just a follow-up question and maybe this is easier said than done but you all have done a lot in terms of these add-on products that drive that PEPY. But have there been learnings when you bring these newer products out that somehow you can just get the quicker kind of attach rates of that like 20% plus target et cetera with the newer products just because from learnings from the prior add-on products? Or is it not that simple to be able to have all that kind of testing and learning?"}
{"doc_type": "earnings_call", "ticker": "PCTY", "period": "2024_Q1", "date": "2023-11-02", "section": "qa", "speaker": "Steve Beauchamp", "text": "Yeah. So I mean these are obviously -- you're talking products that can be maybe $1 PEPM up to several dollars PEPM. And so as you look to add those you first typically see a fair amount of movement with new customers coming on board. So you launch it to the sales force. The two new products we just talked about are available for January starts. So we're already tracking sign-ups for those two products, as we speak. And so that ends up being what I would say is a fairly normal ramp-up rate that has been pretty consistent with various products overtime. So I don't see a big opportunity to move that. We have gotten better over the years though as we sell back to the client base. And that team has scaled and the performance of that team has been really strong. And so I think there's still opportunity for us to continue to improve and drive utilization whether that's things like free trials and better description of the product and just having more headcount talking to our customers. And frankly designing products that customers actually want, so when you put all that together I think the sales back to the client base continues to be an opportunity that we will gradually improve overtime."}

I mean, I think there's still one million targeted business in our target market. We've obviously expanded that target market a little bit on the low end and on the upper end. So that has grown since our IPO in 2014. It still feels like a big market opportunity. I look at the activity levels of the sales force and how many people are they meeting every single week and those remain fairly consistent which tells me that there's a lot of opportunity still out there. And I think on top of that we've had really great success of adding product and a history of innovation so that that average revenue per customer part of the equation is something that we can have confidence in. So I still think there's a ton of opportunity for us to be able to grow this business. We'll be a little -- about $1.4 billion forecasted this year. We're very much focused on what does it take to get to $2 billion and then continue to grow beyond that. So still feels like a large opportunity."}

Our differentiated value proposition of providing the most modern software in the industry continues to resonate in the marketplace and help drive total revenue growth of 34.7% in Q4. For fiscal '23, we reached a key financial milestone for the company with total revenue crossing the $1 billion threshold and finishing at just under $1.2 billion or 37.8% growth over fiscal '22.  Our solid results were once again driven by both adding new clients and employees and increasing average revenue per client. We ended fiscal '23 with 36,200 clients compared to 33,300 at the end of last fiscal year, an increase of 9%. While total employees on the platform grew by mid-teens, consistent with the historical growth trends and in part driven by the success, we're seeing up market as larger clients realize the benefits of our sustained investment in product development and the most modern platform in the industry.  Revenue retention also remained strong at greater than 92%. Average recurring revenue per client was over $30,000 in fiscal '23 compared to just over $25,000 in fiscal '22. An increase of 19% as a result of increased employees on the platform, rising product attach rates across our client base and success with larger clients. We continue to attach more product at the time of sale and have realized increased success selling back into existing clients as our products focused on the most modern workforce resonate across our entire client base.  Our sustained investment in product development allows us to continue to expand our product suite, evidenced by the recent announcement of several new premium offerings and feature enhancements, including Advanced Scheduling, Learning Management and Market Pay. Advanced Scheduling is built upon our existing scheduling capabilities by adding advanced features, such as the ability to match scheduling needs with employees based on job function or role, skill set and certifications as well as swap claim, manage shifts directly via our mobile device.  Similarly, new enhancements to our Learning Management module allows users to easily create and share new training via community, including a new safety training bundle of 20 courses to help clients ensure on-the-job safety and compliance. Lastly, the most recent addition to our suite of modern workforce solutions, Market Pay allows our clients to easily explore, track, manage and compare market pay data across different job families and positions to help make better compensation decisions, evaluate specific roles accurately and comply with pay and equity job posting requirements in multiple states.  Collectively, these 3 new product offerings, along with continued investment across our product suite has increased our PEPY to $500, achieving the target we set 4 years ago. As a result, we are now raising our PEPY target to $600 and are confident in our ability to achieve this goal in the coming years as we continue to develop and deliver market-leading new products.  Our commitment to product development continues to be recognized in the market with Paylocity recently being named an overall leader in 10 HCM product categories in G2's Summer 2023 Grid Reports. Additionally, Paylocity was recognized as TrustRadius top-rated HR management software platform for 2023; won the 2023 Best Human Capital Technology Solution in the SIAA Business Technology CODiE Awards; and achieved the leader ranking in NelsonHall's 2023, Next-Gen HCM Technology NEAT Report for both the SMB and mid and large market segments.  Our strong culture, industry-leading software and exceptional sales and operational execution would not be possible without the dedication and commitment of our employees. As we close out a very strong fiscal '23, I'd like to thank all of our employees for a fantastic year. I would now like to pass the call to Toby to provide further color on the quarter and fiscal '23."}

As Steve highlighted, we continue to build upon our differentiated value proposition of providing the most modern software in the industry with the introduction of new premium products and feature enhancements. While still early, the value proposition of these new capabilities is clearly resonating in the market as evidenced by one of our professional services clients, with over 300 employees, already leveraging market pay to analyze compensation for comparable positions to ensure its payer remains competitive and to help attract and retain high-quality talent in an increasingly tight labor market.  In Q4 and fiscal '23, this dynamic was reflected in solid sales execution across our entire target market, and we plan to continue investing in go-to-market initiatives to carry this momentum forward into fiscal '24. We've expanded our sales force for fiscal '24 by 18% from 694 sales reps in fiscal '23 to 820 reps in fiscal '24, and I'm pleased that we're fully staffed heading into the new fiscal year. We also continue to invest in our channel initiatives, and we remain pleased with the consistency in our referral channel, which continued to deliver more than 25% of our new business in Q4 and full fiscal '23. In addition to an 18% increase in sales reps for fiscal '24, we remain committed to continuing our investments in digital marketing and digital lead generation to support our go-to-market motion.  As a result of our strong financial performance, including our adjusted EBITDA margin of 31.9% and free cash flow margin of 18.4% in fiscal '23, which puts us well into the range of our current financial targets. We are increasing certain of our targets beginning in fiscal '24. This is a reflection of our strong financial performance in fiscal '23, and I'm very pleased with our ability to continue to grow while demonstrating the scalability and leverage in our business model. While Ryan will provide additional detail, we're pleased to continue to target 20%-plus total revenue growth with an increased adjusted EBITDA margin target of 35% to 40% of revenue and an increased free cash flow margin target of 20% to 25% of revenue.  The strong culture of Paylocity continued to be recognized externally this fiscal year as we were named to Built In's Best Places to Work and among the best and brightest companies to work for in the nation. Additionally, for the second year in a row, we also earned placement on the Forbes list for best companies for diversity and best employers for women. Echoing Steve's comments, I would like to thank all of our more than 6,000 employees for a fantastic fiscal '23, which would not have been possible without their dedication and commitment to our clients. I would now like to pass the call over to Ryan to review the financial results in detail and provide fiscal '24 guidance."}

Total revenue for the fourth quarter was $308.5 million, an increase of 34.7% and with recurring and other revenue up 24.3% from the same period last year. As Toby noted, our sales team had another solid quarter, and we were pleased to come in $5.3 million above the top end of our guidance range. Adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter was $100.6 million or 32.6% margin and exceeded the top end of our guidance by $4.1 million. For fiscal '23, adjusted EBITDA was $375.2 million or 31.9% margin, resulting in leverage of 400 basis points versus fiscal '22. Additionally, we made significant progress on free cash flow with fiscal '23 margin of 18.4%, up nearly 650 basis points and an increase of 111% on a dollar basis from fiscal '22. We remain confident in our ability to continue expanding free cash flow margin in fiscal '24 and beyond.  We continue to make significant investments in research and development. And to understand our overall investment in R&D, it is important to combine both what we expense and what we capitalize. On a combined non-GAAP basis, total R&D investments were 15.2% of revenue in the fourth quarter. And on a full year basis, total R&D investments were 14.5% of revenue. On a dollar basis, our year-over-year investment in total R&D increased by 45.7% in fiscal '23 when compared to fiscal '22. We continue to believe our investments in R&D provide us with valuable product differentiation and the ability to drive future growth.  On a non-GAAP basis, sales and marketing expenses were 22% of revenue in the fourth quarter and fiscal '23. On a non-GAAP basis, G&A costs were 10.7% of revenue in the fourth quarter versus 13.2% in the same period last year. Full year G&A costs were 11% of revenue as compared to 12.9% in fiscal '22, and we remain focused on consistently leveraging our G&A expenses on an annual basis. Briefly covering our GAAP results, for Q4, gross profit was $211.7 million; operating income was $49.4 million; and net income was $37.3 million. For the full year, gross profit was $807.6 million. Operating income was $155 million and net income was $140.8 million. In regard to client health funds and interest income, our average daily balance of client funds was $2.5 billion in Q4 and $2.4 billion for fiscal '23. We are estimating the average daily balance will be approximately $2.3 billion to $2.4 billion in Q1 of fiscal '24, with an average annual yield of approximately 410 basis points.  On a full year basis, we are estimating the average daily balance will be $2.5 billion to $2.6 billion in fiscal '24, with an average yield of approximately 420 basis points. Our guidance includes last week's 25 basis point increase, but does not currently include any other changes to interest rates in fiscal '24.  Before I provide our financial guidance, as Toby mentioned, we're updating certain of our key financial targets. Since setting our current targets in August of 2018, our adjusted EBITDA has increased from 21.5% of revenue to 31.9% of revenue, an improvement of over 1,000 basis points. And our free cash flow margin has increased from 12.9% of revenue to 18.4% of revenue, a 550 basis point improvement. As a result of our strong financial performance and the scalability of our business model, we are revising certain key financial targets, which we expect to make progress against beginning in fiscal '24.  In regards to total revenue, our goal of 20%-plus growth remains our target, and we continue to be confident in our ability to achieve this goal. Our adjusted total gross margin target has increased to 75% to 80% from 70% to 75%. Our general and administrative spend target is reduced from 10% to 15% of revenue to 5% to 10% of revenue. Our adjusted EBITDA target has increased to 35% to 40% from 30% to 35%. And our free cash flow margin target is increased to 20% to 25% from 15% to 20%. Please refer to our earnings press release for additional details.  Finally, I'd like to provide our financial guidance for Q1 and full fiscal '24. For the first quarter of fiscal '24, total revenue is expected to be in the range of $314.1 million to $318.1 million or approximately 25% growth over first quarter fiscal '23 total revenue. And adjusted EBITDA is expected to be in the range of $89.5 million to $92.5 million, which represents approximately 250 basis points of leverage over Q1 of fiscal '23. And for fiscal year '24, Total revenue is expected to be in the range of $1.405 billion to $1.410 billion or approximately 20% growth over fiscal '23. And adjusted EBITDA is expected to be in the range of $464 million to $468 million, which represents approximately 120 basis points of leverage over fiscal '23.  As it relates to the broader macro environment, workforce levels continue to be roughly flat in all material respects. This is contrary to what we have historically experienced in a normalized business environment, with recurring revenue typically benefiting from 2 to 3 points of growth driven by broader GDP expansion and workforce levels. Our guidance assumes this trend of flat workforce levels continues in Q1 and fiscal '24 and thereby representing an equivalent of 2- to 3-point headwind to recurring revenue growth. After crossing the $1 billion threshold in fiscal '23 and with continued investments in our go-to-market motion and product road map, we enter fiscal '24 with a high level of confidence in our ability to continue to drive strong revenue growth while simultaneously scaling our business and driving continued adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow leverage.  Operator, we are now ready for questions."}

So we're at the front end of the year and there's a lot of execution in front of us, being able to guide to total revenue of 20% revenue growth, we feel really good about. We've got all the heads on board and up and running, which is always a goal for us at the start of the year. We've got a product suite that we have enhanced pretty significantly. And so we feel pretty good about the momentum.  Certainly, our guidance wouldn't contemplate us being below the 18% on a recurring basis. So I think that's a reasonable way to think about it. But we feel confident in our ability to hit the goals. And I think we have a history of being able to do even better than our initial guidance."}

We really started selling back to the client base back in 2018. So we've been doing that for a number of years. And we've been increasing that inside sales team at a much faster rate than the rest of our sales force, really since we started back in 2018. So that team did really well this past fiscal year. We're really happy with their success. We are certainly increasing that team, be on the average 18% headcount, and so it will have a more material impact going into next fiscal year. But it still represents a small portion of our overall revenue growth.  We are still focused on primarily landing new customers and then continuing to enhance our product portfolio, therefore, giving more products for our inside sales team to sell back to the client base. So yes, it's the right way to think about it. That will gradually continue to get bigger, and it is growing faster than our outside sales team."}

So from an R&D headcount investment, we've been pretty consistent when you look at what we expense and capitalized being around that 15% of R&D. This is definitely a competitive space. It's a pretty dynamic workforce environment where we have lots of product ideas that we get from our customers and that we feel we can add to the product suite. So we've maintained a pretty steady level of R&D investment when you look at it as a percentage of revenue. And I think that philosophy is what we have going forward. There's lots of things that we think we can do to enhance our portfolio.  On the first part of your question, we really started a data practice team about 4 years ago. And so if you go back, we've had predictive capabilities in our platform around who might leave a customer. We've got our MWI based off algorithms. And so we've had a team that's been investing in that space for a while. I think that's what allowed us to get to market relatively quickly with the generative AI capabilities, both in community and now in job descriptions. And we've got a long list of places where we think we can continue to add those capabilities for our customers."}

And I think overall, we feel very good about the guide that we provided going back to Steve's comments a few minutes ago, just getting -- guiding to that 20% mark for the fiscal year. And I think, obviously, like I said, I think the first half is the toughest from a comps perspective. But I think we feel pretty good about the momentum that we have across the business from a recurring perspective.  I'm certainly excited about a lot of the product announcements that we've made and feel pretty good about the adoption that we've seen across the portfolio in the products that we had announced. And I think while it may take -- it's early days for the things that we've just announced, you probably start to see more actual impact from that when you get to the back part of the fiscal year. But I think from a momentum perspective, I feel pretty good about what we're seeing from a sales perspective. We feel pretty good about the momentum we have in new product release and adoption and feel -- I think, overall, I feel very good about being able to guide to 20% for the fiscal."}

And then a follow-up on the long-term target. So it's nice to see the grades on EBITDA and the free cash flow margin. Within gross margin and G&A specifically, can you talk about some of the bigger sources of expansion? Just obviously, understanding natural leverage on broader scale, but are there other key levers you have here to discuss that gives you that confidence?"}

I think gross margin, we've consistently expanded since IPO in 2014. And I think the reason for us being able to do that is you hit one of them scale. But I think the second one is a lot of the new products that we've added don't always require the same lift either from an implementation or ongoing service perspective. You think about the 3 additions that we had now, those are all incremental from a gross margin perspective. So as we see our revenue mix shift, some of the newer products we've added, we get a natural lift in gross margin, and that's probably the biggest driver."}

I think that was the case over the last couple of years, but that is probably steady now.

So we're looking at all aspects of it. We've certainly been actively using that behind the scenes.  I think we've found a lot of success generating test use cases from a code perspective.

So I think you can look at it through 2 different ways. So one is if you -- we talk about the number of employees that we've got kind of on the platform, the average size customer that we have, we give you the employee count, you can really calculate that realized PEPY, which has kind of typically been 50% to 60% of our maximum PEPY. And so that gives you a sense because we bundle and package, that gives you a sense of what they're buying in terms of the total available opportunity.  So there's still lots of opportunity to drive that higher. And so that's probably the easiest way to look at it. I think conceptually, as we build new modules, we definitely feel like that we can get that module into the 10% to 20% range over time. That gives us the ROI and the conviction to be able to kind of build something for customers. Some of our modules are 50%-plus product penetration rate. We've got some still below that 20%. But we've got to have conviction that we can get into that range before we actually build and launch a product."}

And then -- so I know this isn't like the main focus right now, but thinking kind of longer term, the expansion opportunity within the business, kind of how much of that is driven by the increase in a customer's employee count versus increasing PEPY via new products?"}
{"doc_type": "earnings_call", "ticker": "PCTY", "period": "2023_Q4", "date": "2023-08-03", "section": "qa", "speaker": "Steven Beauchamp", "text": "Yes. So historically, in a growth GDP environment, say, GDP was growing 2% or 3%. We would typically get 2% or 3% in our client base of additional employees, which translates to roughly that same revenue growth number because people pay us on a per employee basis. So that was pretty typical. As Ryan mentioned, for over a year now, the number of employees on the platform has been flat. So our clients aren't losing employees, but they're also not adding employees. So there's no necessary tailwind from that.  So really, at this point, when you look at the results we're delivering, there's no help from extra employees on the platform, that all just comes from us selling new customers clearly. And so it's really being driven from selling more to every new customer that's kind of coming on board. And then having that inside sales team I spoke about earlier actually selling back to the client base, that second part being a smaller portion than the first."}

So I think we're definitely squarely focused on the opportunity in the U.S. We still have relatively low penetration in terms of the target market that we're going after. So we see huge TAM that we've got to focus on. And we've definitely got a product set that we think creates differentiation. Where we do see a need to be able to have some global capabilities is when you've got a U.S. headquartered customer, who may have some number of employees abroad.  And so that's why we obviously had purchased Blue Marble and integrated that into our suite, so we can handle that need for customers. So they can Paylocity customer and they can pay their 10, 20, 30, 50 employees abroad through Blue Marble and the network of partners that we leverage. And so that has been our strategy globally. And we'll always look for interesting opportunities, but our primary focus will be U.S.-headquartered companies. And with the size of the TAM that we've got in front of us, we think there's plenty of opportunity there."}

I mean I think, obviously, when you look at -- as I said a few minutes ago, when you look at last fiscal year, you had heavy compares coming in, in the first half. But I think as we got to back half of this last fiscal year, I don't think we saw anything different in terms of seasonality or difference in performance for the quarter or than year-over-year from a sales perspective.  I think the only thing probably note is just going back to comments that we've made over the last probably a handful of quarters and that Steve made a few minutes ago just in terms of how we're seeing incrementally better performance upmarket. But I think that just reflects probably the strength of the solution and what we've done from a product perspective, just being more competitive there over time."}

I've never worked in sales, so please indulge me if this is a bad one. But I'm curious when you think about just the unit count growth of sales reps. Does it -- does the number of heads matter as much if you're targeting larger deals? Do more reps work on a larger deal? Or is it still the same number assigned, just how should we think about targeting larger customers and sales rep count?"}
{"doc_type": "earnings_call", "ticker": "PCTY", "period": "2023_Q4", "date": "2023-08-03", "section": "qa", "speaker": "Steven Beauchamp", "text": "Yes. So we have consistently quoted sales reps based off annual recurring revenue and new annual recurring revenue. Now sales reps' natural behavior is they will go for the larger customers because there's more employees there and that give them more new revenue. But the reality is, we also get a significant business through broker referrals. So that's over 25% of our business. So you've kind of got to follow those leads wherever you can find them. You get client referrals, so you kind of follow wherever you go.  So you can't purely just target the larger customers. You've really got to go after what's available to you. And frankly, some of our best reps, they've got great productivity when you look at the unit volume as well as the amount of product that they sell. And the last thing I would say, we also talked about the fact that some of our most experienced reps, we've specialized and having them focus upmarket. So that's another way that we don't get everybody chasing the bigger deals, but we focus on the best and most experienced people to go after those larger customers. And that's been a good formula for success for us."}

I would say there's no real big call-out when we look at the pipeline. The pipeline is growing nicely as we add reps, and they continue to put more opportunities in top of funnel. It's a little challenging from a history perspective. You think of COVID and all the environment that you came -- you came out of COVID, you had a little bit of a bounce out of COVID in terms of people not having done things for a while.  We're now kind of getting back into a more normalized environment. And so I think as we continue to see the pipeline build and we look at that almost from a pre-COVID level, we feel really good about the activity levels that we're seeing and how we're ramping new reps."}

I think if you step back and probably think about the journey we've been on since we set those initial targets 5 years ago in August of '18, I referenced a few data points in the prepared remarks on adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow leverage that you've seen over that period of time. And as you said, we sit here well into the previous targets, and I think continue to have a lot of confidence in our ability to drive leverage, particularly in gross margin and G&A at the same time, as we have historically invested in sales and marketing in R&D.  And I think when you pull that forward to the initial '24 guide on the backs of significant leverage we saw across adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow in '23, setting out that initial guide, as you said, of north of 100 basis points of adjusted EBITDA leverage, and I think that is certainly something that is reasonably close to what our target would be annually. I think we've had years where we started closer to 50 basis points of leverage and through over performance have been able to take the guide up. But I think we feel good being able to start the year at that 20% revenue growth number, at the same time continue to make progress there on adjusted EBITDA."}

And then maybe just if you can double click on how much you expect growth for the year to come from the installed base selling compared to where maybe fiscal -- where you ended fiscal '23.

I mean I think while it's been different every single year, I think we -- with what we're seeing right now, I don't think we have any different expectations for fiscal '24 in terms of the mix of business relative to what we've seen kind of over the course of fiscal '23. I think to Steve's point, the competitive environment tends -- it's always been competitive. I don't think we see any major shifts there. And I think our plan for '24 contemplates largely what we've been seeing over the course of the last few quarters."}

It seems like a really big step up compared to last year. And so I'm just wondering what lets you this year introduce so much new product? Is it you're just seeing better productivity out of the R&D organization, that the types of products that you're launching or just maybe easier to get into the marketplace? Maybe just help me think about that big step because it seems it's the biggest in several years."}

I think we've been pretty happy with our velocity in R&D overall. Sometimes, these things do happen where you're doing a lot of work on the back end. Some products can take you 9 or 12 months to build. You may have other products that are multiyear efforts that you're kind of working on. So the timing of launch can be very different. And so I think what you're seeing is the product of a couple of years of pretty strong work.  And the other thing I would say is we've also focused on some platform capabilities that would allow us to go faster across R&D. And so I feel like the investments we've made over the last couple of years, you're starting to see now in terms of the new product launches. But I think it actually, more importantly, positions us to be able to have high velocity on a go-forward basis, and that's pretty exciting for us."}

So we've called out the success that we've had up market, and that is where you run into more international opportunity, so customers might have employees in multiple countries. And so definitely Blue Marble has been a component of our product suite that has created some nice differentiation upmarket. So if you're a customer and you've got 1,500 employees and you have 50 employees in 3 different countries, we've got a great solution for you. We can handle everything that you need.  And that does become a differentiation point in terms of us selling those customers. And so I think it's been a nice contributor upmarket. It continues to grow as well when you look at the risk stand-alone revenue that we bring in from those opportunities. But the biggest thing is really focused on the differentiation upmarket."}

Maybe I'll hit the second part and let Steve hit the last part of your question. I think when we set the previous targets in August of '18, I think we're 5 years later, and we were well into those ranges. So I think that's probably the right way to think about it. We don't have a specific year that we'd expect to hit those. But I think at the same time, our expectation would be we'd continue to make progress beginning in '24 on an annual basis towards those revised targets. So continue to have a high degree of confidence in being able to grow the business at a healthy rate, at the same time, scale across the business as well."}

We're going to make the investments in product. We talked about how we're excited about what we've got coming out. We have a rich product pipeline. That is one of the key elements that gives us some confidence on being able to focus on that.  Bringing in the talent from a sales perspective, 18% headcount increase puts us in a really good position to be able to drive that. Huge TAM, right? We've got relatively low penetration in terms of the opportunity. So it really comes down for us to be able to kind of execute. Size of the opportunity is big enough. We've got enough product differentiation. We've got a great pipeline.  And so -- and I think as Toby mentioned, we have strategically made some smaller acquisitions that also have enhanced our capability. I just answered the question around Blue Marble. And so when you put all that together, I think that's what gives us confidence in terms of being able to continue to grow at 20%-plus."}

And so that product worked really well for us. We've made, based on customer feedback, some enhancements to the product on an ongoing basis. The product is doing well.  I think from the first date that we launched it, I never said this was going to be a big needle mover. I really characterize it as a nice feature that customers could take advantage of. And I think that's kind of how it's played out for us overall. But I do think you need a product like that and customers are getting value from it, but it isn't a big driver for us."}

You've got a very dynamic workforce, Gen Z entering the workforce, gig work increasing, globalization kind of back on track and increasing as well. And so it's just a complicated environment for HR teams to really get the talent that they need in a fairly tight labor market.  And so I think when you then overlay that with AI, AI creates opportunities for efficiency for HR teams. It creates opportunity to then use that time from efficiency to be able to drive a more engaging environment and actually really compete on a culture basis. And so we see our early clients doing that. So they're communicating more with their employees. They're driving engagement. We've got a ton of use cases that we plan on rolling out over time that will make it so much easier for communication, engagement, culture-building initiatives. And I think that's going to be really important for our clients as they attempt to win the war for talent."}

We started off fiscal 2025 with strong financial results with recurring and other revenue growth of 14.2% as our differentiated value proposition of providing the most modern software in the industry continues to resonate in the marketplace. Total revenue was $363 million or 14.3% growth over Q1 of last year. Our growth continues to be fueled by our ongoing commitment to driving innovation and providing the most modern software platform in the industry, highlighted by our recent acquisition of Airbase, a modern finance and spend management software solution that combines bill pay, accounts payable automation, expense management, corporate cards and procurement capabilities. The integration of Airbase finance solutions within our existing HCM platform will allow our clients to manage all payroll and non-payroll spend through a single pane of glass, allowing for real-time visibility, faster financial close improved planning and stronger financial controls. Our innovation also continues to be recognized by third parties as Paylocity was recently named an overall leader in 10 HCM product categories in G2's Fall 2024 Grid Reports, marking 24 straight quarters of leading the HCM pack.

In October, we held our annual Elevate Client Conference, where we hosted several thousand business leaders representing HR, finance, IT, and operations across dozens of sessions over the course of two days. At Elevate, we continue to build upon our position as the HCM industry leader in incorporating AI and other emerging technologies into our platform with the launch of the new Paylocity AI Assistant, a powerful conversational AI-driven chatbot designed to streamline HR processes and elevate the employee experience. The Paylocity AI Assistant simplifies HR-related tasks by providing real-time contextual support across our entire platform, enabling our clients to more quickly complete their administrative tasks and answer employee questions, helping to make the Paylocity platform more efficient and improve the employee experience. For example, clients can leverage our AI Assistant to answer common questions such as how do I set blackout dates for PTO or how do I adjust my accrual rates.

We're similarly happy with the consistency of our referral channel, which, once again, delivered more than 25% of our new business in Q1. The strong culture of Paylocity continues to be recognized externally as we were recently named to the Fortune's Best Workplaces in Technology in 2024. Echoing Steve's comments, I would like to thank all of our more than 6,000 employees for a strong start to fiscal 2025. I would now like to pass the call to Ryan to review the financial results in detail and provide updated fiscal 2025 guidance."}
{"doc_type": "earnings_call", "ticker": "PCTY", "period": "2025_Q1", "date": "2024-10-30", "section": "qa", "speaker": "Ryan Glenn", "text": "Thanks, Toby. Total revenue for the first quarter was $363 million, an increase of 14.3% with recurring and other revenues up 14.2% from the same period last year. Our sales team had a solid start to the year, and we were pleased to come in $4.5 million above the top end of our revenue guidance with the majority of our revenue beat coming from recurring and other revenue, allowing us to raise our fiscal year guidance by more than our Q1 beat with a further increase in revenue guidance due to the impact of the Airbase acquisition. As a reminder, the Airbase acquisition closed on October 1 and did not impact our financial results in Q1. Our adjusted gross profit was 74% for Q1 versus 72.4% [ph] in Q1 of last year, representing 60 basis points of leverage as we continue to focus on scaling our operational costs while maintaining industry-leading service levels. We continue to make significant investments in research and development and to understand our overall investment in R&D, it is important to combine both what we expense and what we capitalize. On a dollar basis, our year-over-year investment in total R&D increased by 9.1% when compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2024, and we remain focused on making investments in R&D throughout fiscal 2025 as we continue to build out the Paylocity platform to serve the needs of the modern workforce. In regards to our go-to-market activities, on a non-GAAP basis, sales and marketing expenses were 21.6% of revenue in the first quarter and we remain focused on making investments in this area of the business in fiscal 2025 to drive continued growth. On a non-GAAP basis, G&A costs were 9.5% of revenue in the first quarter versus 10.3% in the same period last year, representing 80 basis points of leverage as we remain focused on consistently leveraging our G&A expenses on an annual basis. Our adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter was $129 million, or 35.5% margin, and exceeded the top end of our guidance by $8.5 million and represented 250 basis points of leverage versus Q1 of fiscal 2024. Excluding the impact of interest income on funds held for clients, adjusted EBITDA margin for Q1 was 29.8%, reflecting operating leverage of 270 basis points versus the same period last year. Briefly covering our GAAP results for Q1 gross profit was $248 million, operating income was $64.1 million, and net income was $49.6 million. In regard to the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $778.5 million, which includes a $325 million we drew down on our revolving credit facility in late September to fund the acquisition of Airbase that closed on October 1. In regard to client-held funds and interest income, our average daily balance of client funds was approximately $2.6 billion in Q1. We are estimating the average daily balance will be approximately $2.65 billion in Q2 with an average annual yield of approximately 400 basis points, representing approximately $26.5 million of interest income in Q2. On a full year basis, we are estimating the average daily balance will be approximately $2.75 billion with an average yield of approximately 390 basis points, representing approximately $108 million of interest income. In regard to interest rates, our guidance reflects the recent 50 basis point rate cut in September with an additional rate cut of 25 basis points in each of November, December, March and May, for a total of 150 basis points of rate cuts included in guidance. Additionally, given the confidence we have in our business and our strong cash flows, we may continue to execute against the remaining $350 million authorized in our share repurchase program over the course of fiscal 2025. To date, we have repurchased $150 million or approximately 1.1 million shares of common stock, reducing diluted shares outstanding by approximately 600,000 shares or 1.1% as of September 30 versus the same period last year. Finally, I'd like to provide our financial guidance for Q2 and full fiscal year 2025. We are increasing our fiscal 2025 guidance based on two key factors: first, our strong results in Q1 and the momentum across our sales organization as we enter the heart of selling season; and second, the impact of Airbase, which is expected to represent approximately 1% of total revenue in fiscal 2025. Additionally, we are updating our adjusted EBITDA guidance based on two key factors. First is our strong results in Q1 and increased organic profitability expectations for fiscal 2025. And second, the dilutive impact of Airbase. While Airbase is expected to dilute adjusted EBITDA margin by approximately 100 basis points this fiscal year, we are realizing increased success in driving profitable growth across our business, helping to offset this impact. With that said, for the second quarter of fiscal 2025, recurring and other revenue is expected to be in the range of $337.5 million to $342.5 million or approximately 14% growth over second quarter fiscal 2024 recurring revenue. And total revenue is expected to be in the range of $364 million to $369 million or approximately 12.3% growth over second quarter fiscal 2024 total revenue. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be in the range of $116 million to $120 million, and adjusted EBITDA, excluding interest income on funds held for clients, is expected to be in the range of $89.5 million to $93.5 million. And for fiscal 2025, we are increasing recurring and other revenue guidance, which is now expected to be in the range of $1.427 billion to $1.442 billion or approximately 12% growth over fiscal 2024 recurring and other revenue. Total revenue guidance is also increasing and is expected to be in the range of $1.535 billion to $1.550 billion or approximately 10% growth over fiscal 2024. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be in the range of $530 million to $540 million and adjusted EBITDA, excluding interest income on funds held for clients, is expected to be in the range of $422 million to $432 million. In conclusion, we are pleased with our Q1 results and the momentum we have across our sales and operations team as we enter the busiest time of the year. Operator, we are now ready for questions."}

Thanks for taking my question. Toby, Steve, I wanted to start off with Airbase. You've had the asset for about 30 days now. Maybe any initial observations since you've had it? And then how do we think about specifically kind of your go-to-market motion around this product and enabling the sales force? How much of a different type of the sale will this be, and will you also really need a separate sales force to sell Airbase? Or can your existing sales force effectively sell this?"}

And I think so far, we've spent a bunch of time with the team. We're really happy with the team that's kind of come over in the acquisition. We started very early stages integrating things like go-to-market motion, product strategy. So I don't think we have all the answers right now. I think we still feel very confident with the thesis, which is the ability to be able to sell back to our customers spend management solution where we leverage the employee data to really automate many of the workflows, much of the spend activity. And then on the back end of that being able to really leverage the data insights. I think our conversations with their teams and our teams together, we feel really confident that, that will offer a tremendous amount of value. I think if you look at historically how we've approached acquisitions, it typically has taken us somewhere in the 12 months to 18 months to have a fully integrated product to market. We'll do this in stages. This is obviously bigger and stand-alone. And so we won't wait that entire time to start gaining value from it. But we feel like we can leverage some of our internal go-to-market motion as we've sold back to the client base many other products and be able to do the same thing with the Airbase solution."}

And then, Toby, you talked about a strong start to the selling season. You're pleased with what you've seen to date. I guess, as you look at the transactions in Q1 and how you're thinking about this busy selling season, is the composition of deals kind of different today versus a year ago? I didn't know if you're seeing maybe more net new customers in the pipeline versus some expansion activity or maybe that fits from that viewpoint."}
{"doc_type": "earnings_call", "ticker": "PCTY", "period": "2025_Q1", "date": "2024-10-30", "section": "qa", "speaker": "Toby Williams", "text": "Yes. I would say, overall, we're definitely in the heart of selling season. And I think so far, we are pleased with the momentum we're seeing, feel good about how the team is executing. Obviously, a big part of our ability to beat in Q1 was relative to our performance from a sales and go-to-market perspective. So I think that feels good. The momentum of that carrying into selling season feels good. I think the demand environment feels good and stable to us. And then I think the execution of the team, both from a go-to-market perspective and then also relative to our channel performance also feels good. And I think we're seeing a consistent mix of both new business and back to base with what we would have seen last quarter and over the last few quarters. So I think all of that feels -- the momentum and all of that also feels good, feels strong."}

It's good to see the next quarter. Ryan, maybe one for you. Just as I think about the guidance increase, it's been uneven in terms of in the past few quarters of flowing through beats just as we digested what was going on in the macro environment? So flowing the full beat forward, can you maybe help us understand what gives you the confidence? Is it the start to the selling season? Are there other green shoots that you're seeing? Just maybe help me understand that, and then I have a follow-up."}
{"doc_type": "earnings_call", "ticker": "PCTY", "period": "2025_Q1", "date": "2024-10-30", "section": "qa", "speaker": "Ryan Glenn", "text": "Sure. Yes. Thanks, Samad. So as you think about the guidance increase, particularly on the recurring side, we increased guidance by $22 million. I think of that as roughly two thirds of that are the impact of Airbase, as you quantified on the call, roughly 1% of revenue this year. And to your point, I think the balance of the guide is the entirety of the Q1 beat, plus some incremental upside. And I think that's really driven off of the momentum we're seeing in the sales force. I think we obviously are looking at activity levels, demand levels. And to Toby's point, I think each of those items have been -- continue to be strong. So as we look at where we are relative to pipeline and relative to execution required to hit our January numbers in the back half, we felt very confident that we were able to pass all of that beat in Q1 as well as something incrementally through."}

And then maybe this could be for Steve or for Toby. But when you think about it from a product perspective on Airbase and the integration there, can you walk through maybe what some of the efforts you have on the product side, how long we should think that, that part in particular should take? And how soon it'd take to make it look like it was one product or a single pane of glass for products on, for customers on both sides of the product?"}
{"doc_type": "earnings_call", "ticker": "PCTY", "period": "2025_Q1", "date": "2024-10-30", "section": "qa", "speaker": "Steve Beauchamp", "text": "Yes, sure. So I think just our approach generally towards prior product acquisitions is we definitely want to take the time so that we can deliver the right level of user experience and truly deliver an integrated solution. You can see that with our head count, product launch, which clients can be starting on in January, which we feel really good about. I think this is a little bit different because they've got a little bit more of a substantial stand-alone client base. And so there is an opportunity for us to attack this a little bit more incrementally, maybe a little bit more how we attack something like Blue Marble. And so I would see this continuing to get more integrated and better. As time goes on, I think we believe that we'll make some improvements to that really certainly in the first year of having that acquisition, but you'll see even greater improvement come between 12 months and 24 months, and we'll continue to integrate those solutions. So you think of things like workflows and insights and reporting, that might take a little bit longer. But once you start delivering those, you really truly get the value of the integrated platform. So it's a big acquisition for us. It's important to us. We're focused on it, and we feel confident we're going to be able to deliver the right solution to our customers."}

{"doc_type": "earnings_call", "ticker": "PCTY", "period": "2025_Q1", "date": "2024-10-30", "section": "qa", "speaker": "Steve Beauchamp", "text": "Yes. I mean, I think at the end of the day, the existing clients don't have a lot of exposure to it. They probably see the press release and some of the news and don't necessarily have a good impression in terms of how that will impact them. I think the idea, though, that they understand is our ability to leverage the employee record and then be able to help other challenges that are disconnects in their organizations already. So communication between an HCM and a financial platform is a point of disconnect that we've heard from our customers. You see us addressing that with the head count planning solution, the concept of me able to manage spend data, where I can, as a manager, approve spend in the same spot that we're approving time off. It's pretty interesting to them. So I think they get it conceptually. We certainly are not at the point in time where we've rolled anything out to current clients. But we're excited about the concepts and the reaction that we're getting. I think the second thing I would say to you is, we do have a subset of mutual customers. It's not a huge number, but we have spent time talking to those mutual customers, and they are providing us feedback and are even more excited about the opportunity that they will have as we continue to integrate the platforms."}

And then with regards to the performance during the quarter, I mean, the margin improvement is really impressive. I'm wondering if you can just talk about -- a little bit more about the leverage areas that you would expect over the course of the year. You certainly saw leverage in terms of sales and marketing and G&A. G&A, we always expect. But how are we thinking about the sales and marketing and then the gross profit margin ex-float?"}

So I think to your point, really pleased with the results in Q1, 270 basis points of adjusted EBITDA leverage ex-float. I'd add, too, on free cash flow as you look at over the last 12 months, free cash flow margin of about 23%. So that's up nicely over the same period over the prior year. Where I'd expect to see leverage is largely consistent with what we saw in Q1. So 60 basis points of gross margin leverage. I think that's an area that we continue to see opportunities to scale both through general efficiencies as well as automation. G&A, to your point, is one where we would expect to see leverage annually as well. And I think sales and marketing and R&D are not necessarily areas that we look to drive leverage. But I think as we approach $1.5 billion of revenue moving towards $2 billion, we're certainly thoughtful on customer acquisition costs and prioritizing investments because I think at that size and scale, expectation would be that you're mindful of each of those items. So I wouldn't put those at the forefront necessarily, but it wouldn't surprise me if we did see some efficiencies there as well."}

Maybe to stick with the Airbase theme and maybe attack it from a little bit different angle. So I think in the past, when you launch new products, I think you said the goal is to try to get it into 10% to 20% of the customer base in a few years of launching. As I think about Airbase, does that have the same characteristics of the ability to push at that same velocity? Or is there significant differences in terms of how we should think about cross-sell momentum in the future?"}

So I think you stated it very accurately, we definitely like to target between 10% and 20% penetration over several years. I think Airbase is a more substantial company and has a stand-alone customer base. And so there's certainly an opportunity to continue to grow that. But we definitely believe the big opportunity is the nearly 40,000 customers that we can sell back to. And so if we were to fast forward several years from now, we saw that 10% plus penetration number, that would be a big success. And that - it might take a little longer than that several years, but we definitely think over time getting into that 10% or 20% target is certainly feasible and something that we're going to focus on."}

So I think part of the integration work that we're doing is obviously working closely with the FP&A team at Airbase and I think we have spent a lot of time with them over the last month. So feel very comfortable about how we're able to model and truly incorporate that business into all of our planning broadly, but certainly relative to guidance. So nothing I would point out there relative to concerns. I think as we talked about over the last, call it, 60 days or so. That business has grown nicely historically and continues to do so. So as we go further into the year, I think we'll be able to provide some incremental color but able to factor in the trajectory of the business to date, both into revenue and profitability guidance."}

I mean one is - I think one of the keys, as we've talked about, was the twofold expansion of the TAM into the office of the CFO, which I think has been a - which has been an area that's been really attractive from a software category standpoint. And I think going back to some of Steve's comments, I think our ability to take the time now that we've closed on the transaction to integrate that product set into our platform will give us the ability to, as noted, both add new clients to the platform and then the bigger opportunity of going back into the customer base. I think one of the other things that we've talked about is we continue to believe we have the opportunity to expand PEPY as we have done from an HCM standpoint. But I also - the opportunity to expand the TAM is certainly a focus of going into the office of the CFO and a focus of the acquisition of Airbase and then building those products into the platform. The revenue model is slightly different from a PEPY perspective. And so I think one of the things that we'll be working through as we integrate the business is what does that pricing model look like and how to factor that in, in terms of how we're talking about the TAM that we're focused on both from an HCM standpoint and from a spend management or from a finance application standpoint. And I think that's part of the work that we'll -- that we are doing in the course of the integration effort."}

I think it's important to us in a couple of different ways. I mean, one is I think we -- our approach from a platform integration perspective, I think, has been differentiated in the industry. I think that is -- it's a significant value add from a client standpoint, the ability to have an open platform where you can integrate third-party products, whether that's moving data between, for example, our platform and a carrier or another benefits related product is something that our clients see as really valuable. I think that's also really important for our channel partners. Again, more than 25% plus of our -- more than 25% of our new business is referred to us from channel partners, which is, in large part, brokers. And so I think there's a number of things that are really important to us from a strategy perspective in terms of how we've approached our marketplace and our integration efforts more broadly. And I think that's been a really impactful contributor to, not just our revenue growth, but to our client satisfaction and the differentiation that we've been able to drive from a competitive perspective."}

As you think about Marketplace, I think Toby highlighted a lot of client value points. There's times where we may monetize some of that via partner revenue streams.

I don't think we have perfect data, but we certainly understand the market as a whole before kind of entering that space. There still is a fair amount of I'm managing this via spreadsheet through manual processes and you think about maybe the core part of our marketplace and our average size customer. As you get to larger customer size, then they may be using different software solutions, either add-on to an ERP or some separate solution to be able to manage that. So it's definitely a bit of mix. We think there's a real opportunity to be able to provide differentiation when you really combine that with the HCM data. And so certainly, the that have not automated yet are obvious customers, but also those that might have a series of several solutions put together to try to get to the same objective and the idea of coming to a single platform, we think, can be attractive to them as well."}

{"doc_type": "earnings_call", "ticker": "PCTY", "period": "2025_Q1", "date": "2024-10-30", "section": "qa", "speaker": "Steve Beauchamp", "text": "That's a great question. I think you have to really get down to the value that's being driven from the implementation of AI across your platform, and they get down to really practical examples for customers. So is it going to be easier for me to find reports across the system. Can I get the answers to the questions that I have super-fast and much easier than I have before. Are you providing me the embedded writing assistance that I might be able to really save time on. And so I think there's a lot of conversations broadly around how AI can snap your fingers and have a big giant change, but it's really an evolutionary change. So all of our product teams really try to think about ways that they could use platform capabilities and AI to really improve the client experience. And then when you start demonstrating those experience to customers and they start seeing the time savings, the incremental insights they can get from that, that's where the value derives versus having maybe just -- while I think their chatbot that does all of it, it's got to appear differently to the customer. So the way we think about it is embedding this across the platform and really trying to drive value back to the customers. And you see that with our most recent introduction of a chatbot. It's really going to allow them to get answers to their questions. Right at their fingertips. We don't want to take away the service component of our offering, but there's times where that's just convenient for a customer and that self-service capability is going to create better satisfaction. And so we just think that AI is not a product on its own, but an embedded part of our platform."}

Gentlemen, thank you for taking my questions and congratulations on the quarter. I guess, the first question is, as you're all kind of looking into the selling season, you have a very large sales force, you've got a building pipeline. Is there anything that's different kind of in the selling season from a target customer persona in terms of maybe the average size of these deals in your pipeline versus the last couple of years? I think you crossed over like 150-plus employees in terms of average customer size. Is anything different in terms of kind of the makeup of the pipeline this year versus maybe prior years? And then a follow-up."}

I mean, I think the one callout that we've made pretty consistently over the last, call it, two to three years is just the extent to which we've continued to see success and traction slightly upmarket from where we've been, which we talked a lot about. And I think that continues to be the case and continues to be true. And I think we're -- we've seen -- I think over the last number of quarters, we've seen -- we've continued to see traction and performance there. So that's less of a new this quarter call out and more of the trend that we've seen pretty consistently on a pretty even trajectory over the course of the last two to three years. And I don't think there's any different persona involved in that or anything. I think it's just -- that continues to be the case and is the trend over the last couple of years."}

I'm really pleased with the attendance, which was up from last year, and we had -- we're also really pleased with the breadth of attendance from a role perspective. We had attendance from HCM or HR, finance, operations teams really across the spectrum from our clients in terms of the roles that are represented. And it's always a great opportunity to both connect with our customers and give them a view of what we're doing that's new and different for the year, be able to connect on new products and overall, just drive a higher level of activity engagement with our clients, which I think was also a focus for this year. And overall, really pleased with how the conference turned out and appreciated all the attendance we had from our clients and all of the -- all the work went into it from an employee standpoint. So overall, really pleased with the success of it again this year."}

Is there a sweet spot in terms of the target customer within Airbase, perhaps by size or industry? It did seem from your earlier comments that your whole customer base is addressable. But I was wondering, in particular, if Airbase could help you move up market. As I would imagine, some of your larger customers would be using a solution, perhaps."}

So I would tell you, one of the things we really liked about Airbase is the customer size overlap in terms of our average sized customer. So obviously, they don't have the number of customers we do, but they're -- when you look at their average size, it was very close our average size. And so that's where the need of our customers obviously lie. That is part of what gives us confidence that we can get to kind of those milestones in terms of 10% to 20% penetration over the next several years. And so that's good. I think the other thing I would say is, Airbase has also been on a very similar journey that you would see with any products that we've released, which is you start by going after that average [ph] size customer, you get customer feedback. And based off that customer feedback, you make those products even better. And they typically, as they get better, they get stronger as you move up market. We've seen that with pretty much every module we've released. I think Airbase has also been on that exact same journey. So I think the near-term opportunity is at the core of our marketplace. And then over time, if we execute the same playbook we have with other products, we'll be able to gradually move that size up over time as well."}

Just on the Airbase front, can you talk about some of the learnings you've had with your earlier products in the office of the CFO, and just your ability to address that type of buyer that influence the deal or that you may actually do differently as you enter the market this time around?"}
{"doc_type": "earnings_call", "ticker": "PCTY", "period": "2025_Q1", "date": "2024-10-30", "section": "qa", "speaker": "Steve Beauchamp", "text": "Yes, sure. Obviously, the CFO is going to be a different persona than you would see you in HR. It's not a new persona for us. It's certainly somebody that is often the final person that might sign the deal. When it comes to HCM, they -- as you think of our core market, the 100 employees or 150 employees, they oftentimes are involved in those meetings and very much sit through the demonstration and our key decision makers. So it's not brand new for us. Obviously, that's not their maybe primary domain that they're running, although there are times that payroll reports into the office of the CFO. But you definitely see there's an element of ROI. There's an element of making sure that they're going to get adoption of the products to be able to drive the value. There's certainly an idea of managing costs and controlling expenses. And so we think all of those really key important things that a CFO is focused on are key elements of what Airbase is offering. So we think that as we integrate the products, it's going to tie pretty nicely into our process. We don't know whether how much of that is going to happen at the first time we bring on new customers and how much of that is going to be selling back to the client base. We've had great success in selling back to the client base, so we feel pretty confident that we can kind of figure that one out. But it isn't a brand-new persona for us. We feel pretty confident we can work pretty well with CFOs buying and decision-making process."}

And then can you just talk about the early feedback you've gotten for your AI? Is it just the ROI that customers are seeing with that?

{"doc_type": "earnings_call", "ticker": "PCTY", "period": "2025_Q1", "date": "2024-10-30", "section": "qa", "speaker": "Steve Beauchamp", "text": "Yes. The last part first. I don't think we've really focused on trying to develop a monetizable solution from an AI perspective. And I think the reason is we've seen so many opportunities to be able to embed AI capabilities across our entire suite and really add value and create differentiation in the marketplace. And so from a chatbot perspective, we see a couple of big opportunities. So first, it's the ability to answer questions really quickly for our customers. And sometimes, its questions that maybe they wouldn't normally call for, I just need a quick answer. I forgot how to do something. I'm doing something very much for the first time. Super-fast, super easy, very direct is the feedback we've gotten. And the beauty of AI, as all of you know, is we get feedback from the customer. So we get -- our answer rate continues to improve the more interactions you get with the customer and the more that we continue to add data to the model. So we're really excited about the early trajectory of that product. The second opportunity, as we think about longer term, you can also think about answering employees' questions. So HR departments get a lot of questions from employees. And so the more questions that you can offload from an HR perspective, we think the more value that you can add from a customer as well. So those are the two primary use cases we've gotten positive feedback from customers."}

And I think as we came into Q4, our comment was that had -- we've seen stability there. And I think that would probably still be the comment today. I think we have seen that, but it's pretty stable at this point and not really any call out to make on a quarter-to-quarter basis versus where we would have been in Q4."}

I mean, it is a pretty broad platform that handles a number of pain points for customers in that category. I think first mission for us is integrating the platforms and driving value back to the customers and then obviously driving volume after that. And so I think we're pretty focused on that. We're open to new opportunities, though. I think if you think our client journey has always been client as a co-creator. So we're going to get feedback through that as we scale customers, we're going to find new opportunities. Those new opportunities will certainly be largely organically building on top of that and looking at new opportunities. But we're open and highly selective to look at external M&A opportunities if they present themselves. But I think right now, we're very much focused on this being an important first step. We also have our headcount planning solution module that launched in January. So that does give us another product in that category as well. So certainly, opportunities to expand. It is a big category, and it's one where we really want to focus on the HCM data providing leverage."}

I think as I mentioned earlier and noted in the prepared remarks as well, I think there was a couple of factors on the raise to the year. So one was certainly, the $5 million beat we saw on the recurring side in Q1. And then we took a further raise for the momentum we're seeing across the sales organization headed into the heart of selling season. And then the third piece would be Airbase. I think, to size those two-thirds of the raise so that the two-thirds of the 22 million we raised on recurring would be Airbase and the remaining one-third, roughly would be organic revenue that we raised to the year."}

I think as we called out when we initially provided fiscal 2025 guidance in early August that our desire was to get back to a beat and raise cadence. And I think we obviously did that here in Q1 and feel good about the momentum across the business. So I think our view would be if we continue to see solid execution that we continue to be in a position where we'd be able to beat and raise guidance as we move throughout the year. I think from a macro standpoint, Q1 came in modestly better than expectations. As I mentioned earlier, the vast majority of the beat that we saw in Q1 was really driven off of sales momentum, but modestly better than expectations. So we factored that into guidance, although I think we continue to be in a spot where we're being pretty prudent and thoughtful relative to the macro. So have not gotten particularly aggressive there. So if we see continued trends as we saw in Q1, that may result in a bit of upside over the balance of the fiscal as well."}

And so it's not a brand new investment for us, and it's one that we've obviously expanded as we've seen incremental use cases. And so I don't think that we foresee any reason to need some outsized sort of step-up expense. We think we can fit our AI investments into the existing forecast that we've provided and that we can continue to innovate at a pretty accelerated rate based off what we've already created and the capabilities that we have internally."}

So year-over-year, you'd likely see workforce levels up modestly, but I think we continue to take a fairly cautious and prudent approach and we'll obviously update guidance as we go throughout the year to the extent we get further evidence of stability.
